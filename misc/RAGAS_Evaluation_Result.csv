As HCWs do appear to have an increased risk for ARI (OR = 1.3) it would be plausible to expect an effect of similar order for influenza infections. Although study limitations might have led to a failure to detect a true increase, it is unlikely that we have missed a large difference in the risk of influenza.\n\nThe objective of this study was to address the question of whether HCWs in the acute care hospital setting have a higher risk of serologically confirmed influenza infections (SCII) than non-HCWs, and to assess the proportion of individuals with SCII who experience either any respiratory symptoms or an influenza-like illness.']"," Based on the provided context, it seems that the study found that HCWs in the acute care hospital setting did not have a higher risk of serologically confirmed influenza infections (SCII) compared to non-HCWs. This could be due to several factors such as low prevalence of infectious influenza patients, effective infection control measures, and prior immunity among HCWs. Therefore, the answer is 'lower risk of influenza'.
