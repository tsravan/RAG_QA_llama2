Sequence analysis was carried out following an established protocol using the ANNIE resource [4,5]. The 469 amino acid long neuraminidase (NA) protein (Figure 1) is essential for release of the viral particle from the outer membrane of infected cells by cleaving sialic acid from host glycoproteins that are recognized by the viral hemagglutinin [6]. As a type II transmembrane protein, it is N-terminally attached to the membrane [7]. It consists of a tiny cytoplasmic tail at the N-terminus (residues 1 to 6) [8] followed by the transmembrane region (residues 7 to 34) that is also responsible for translocation of the protein [9].",

Such unstructured linker regions are rich in small and polar residues and often harbour sites for posttranslational modifications [10,11]. Probable posttranslational modification sites in the neuraminidase of the new strain are glycosylation motifs involving N88, N146 and N235, which correspond to residues that are also glycosylated in other subtype neuraminidases [12]. However, the minimal and non-specific consensus motif of glycosylation sites (Nx [ST]) is found in total 8 times in the new strain sequence with an apparent clustering (50%) in the unstructured linker region (Figure 1). Interestingly, another putative novel glycosylation site N386, which is unique to the new strain, would be accessible on the surface, as seen in the structural models.",

Nevertheless, this region harbours a cysteine (Figure 2) that can be aligned over multiple NA subtypes and is conserved in N1-N5 and N8, but not in N6, N7 and N9. Earlier reports assume that, at least in related viruses, cysteines in the non-globular region could be involved in intermolecular disulfide bridges [13-15]. Alternatively, by analogy to other influenza proteins such as hemagglutinin [16] and M2 protein [17], it cannot yet be excluded that cysteine C49 is palmitoylated and that the anchor localizes the protein to lipid rafts [18].",

Redundancy was removed with cd-hit at a level of maximal 90% sequence identity [20], the remaining sequences were aligned with MAFFT (using L-INS-I settings [21]) and the resulting multiple alignment was visualized and annotated in Jalview [22]. A neighbour joining tree with pairwise gap deletion, Poisson correction as distance measure and 500 bootstrap replicates (generated with MEGA [23]) produces robust groupings consistent with previous studies [24] for the known NA subtypes (clustering of N1, N4, N5+N8 on one side and N2, N3, N6+N7+N9 on the other) and reliably places the new NA with other N1s. Interestingly, inside the N1 cluster, the new NA appeared close to the N1 of H5N1 avian flu viruses. The alignment and corresponding phylogenetic tree are available at .",

A characteristic clustering emerges (Figure 3) that roughly corresponds to host and geographic distributions, consistent with previous reports [25,26]. The observed clustering is robust in respect to the method used for tree generation (same for maximum parsimony or neighbour joining trees with JTT distance and gamma-distributed variable rates). The 2009 NA is part of a cluster of avian-like swine flu H1N1 strains predominantly found in European pigs. However, previous examples of human infections from swine flu are also part of the same cluster, for example from 2005 in Thailand [27]. This indicates that, similar to the current outbreak, closely related H1N1 strains have crossed species boundaries on previous occasions as also evidenced by further reports in the literature [28-30].",

Combinations of HA and NA subtypes need to be fine-tuned to recognize the same type of sialic acid modifications to allow smooth interplay of the two proteins, which is important for the viral cycle [6]. These results support the notion that, also inside the family of N1 subtypes, a clear distinction can be made between avian-like H1N1, such as the one from the current outbreak, and other existing H1N1 strains.",

While the drug binding pocket remains unaffected by these most recent mutations, the N248D substitution changes a central part of an antibody recognition site.

However, we have to admit that it remains essentially impossible to quantify the influence of non-direct interactions by theoretical means unambiguously. In our experience, co-evolution measures such as the one proposed and several others (PMID: 18056067) produce high rates of false positives and, therefore, the interpretation is difficult. We did the requested analysis with Ranganathan's SCA algorithm to eventually identify connected networks of residues using the webserver implementation at the Gerstein lab, but no network that would connect the surface directly to the core and catalytic site was found (see supplementary webpage for full details). In fact, all positions of the observed mutations are at the surface and naturally variable, as judged by the conservation and SCA analysis, which would rather indicate that they do not have an effect on the structure of the more distant binding pocket. A possible problem why the SCA could not work in this case is the high level of sequence similarity among the neuraminidases which only gives limited numbers of informative correlated mutations. This is a totally different scenario from alignments of highly divergent sequences that still have the same fold, such as the small PDZ domains analyzed by Ranganathan. In the case of a diverse family with shared fold, correlated mutations are indicative of allowed fluctuations also among structurally important residues. However, with the neuraminidases, most variation can be attributed to surface residues, which makes sense given the pressure to avoid immune responses. Additionally, sequence sampling of neuraminidases is not independent but biased by transmission chains and clusters of outbreaks. A possible but also not necessarily more precise alternative to judge indirect effects on drug binding would be to run free energy simulations with the bound drug to judge changes of affinity caused by the mutations but this is a tricky and time-consuming endeavour that would burst the scope of this current manuscript.",

The current knowledge of the scenario for H1N1 is that around the late 1970s to early 1980s, a human-avian reassortant virus started to be detected in European pigs as host (PMID: 8091678). Then, this avian-like swine flu started to move from the European continent to the UK in the early 90s (PMID: 9049404). More reassortments and emergence of the N2 subtype that quickly spread is also well documented. This phylogenetic analysis plugs the new H1N1 strain into the already known clusterings among the NA subtypes and within the N1 family.",
