In many cases, it has allowed an unprecedented ability to examine the effect of mutations not only on virus replication in tissue culture, but also on pathogenesis in the natural host. For some organisms this has led to the development of rationally attenuated viruses (Cavanagh et al., 2007) or improved vaccine candidates (Macadam et al., 2006).",

The discovery of MNV has allowed an unprecedented analysis of the role of viral sequences in norovirus translation, replication and pathogenesis in the natural host. As a result, MNV is used widely as a model system for the human noroviruses, a major cause of viral gastroenteritis in man (Wobus et al., 2006). The murine norovirus genome contains four reading frames (Fig. 1A); ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein which is cleaved co- and post-translationally to produce the viral non-structural proteins required for viral genome replication (NS1-7) (Sosnovtsev et al., 2006); ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein VP1; ORF3 encodes a minor structural protein whereas ORF4 encodes a protein of unknown function (Sosnovtsev et al., 2006).",

However infectious virus was not recovered by transfection of capped in vitro transcribed MNV RNA into a number of efficiently transfected cell lines, including human 293T and hamster BHK cells, which although not permissive to infection by MNV viral particles, resulted in robust virus release when transfected with purified VPg-linked viral RNA (Chaudhry et al., 2007). In addition, transfection of in vitro transcribed capped viral RNA into the highly permissive, but more refractile to transfection RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line also failed to result in virus recovery. However, in this case, difficulties in the efficient delivery of RNA may have had a major impact on the ability to recover virus.",

This plasmid, pT7:MNV 3\u2032Rz also contains a unique NheI restriction site after a 27 nucleotide long poly-A tail, followed by a 3\u2032 hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence (Fig. 1A). A derivative of this in which the NS7 RNA polymerase coding sequence contains a frame-shift (pT7:MNV 3\u2032Rz F/S) has also been described previously (Chaudhry et al., 2007). Synthetic genomic RNA was prepared by T7 transcription of both plasmids as described in the materials and methods. Subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) was generated by transcription of a PCR product designed to introduce a T7 promoter at the 5\u2032 end with a 30 nucleotide long 3\u2032 poly-A tail (see Section 2 for details). Capped RNA was then generated using the ScriptCap enzymatic capping system and the effect of capping on the efficiency of the translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates examined. Rabbit reticulocyte lysates were programmed with either capped or uncapped RNAs and protein synthesis levels examined (Fig. 1B). Whereas uncapped MNV genomic or subgenomic RNA failed to translate efficiently in vitro, enzymatically capped RNA typically produced >10-fold more protein in vitro (Fig. 1B).",

As will be discussed later, this may be at least partly due to the inefficiency of capping and/or the stimulation of the interferon response as a result of transfecting 5\u2032 phosphorylated RNA (Hornung et al., 2006; Nallagatla et al., 2007; Pichlmair et al., 2006). To examine if enzymatic capping of RNA could be used to overcome some of these issues and be efficiently translated in cells, a heterologous cell system, namely human embryonic kidney cells (293T) or baby hamster kidney cells (BSR-T7) were transfected with either capped or uncapped viral RNA transcripts then the levels of viral protein examined by western blot (Fig. 2). As expected, uncapped MNV genomic or subgenomic RNA did not produce detectable levels of viral proteins after transfection of either 293 or BSR-T7 cells. However, transfection of enzymatically capped RNA resulted in efficient and robust viral protein synthesis (Fig. 2). High levels of the viral NS7 protein, the product of open reading frame 1, was readily detected when capped viral genomic RNA was transfected into either cell type, whereas transfection of the viral subgenomic RNA lead to high levels of VP2 synthesis upon transfection of 293T cells only (Fig. 2). Note that VP2 expression was detected in BSR-T7 cells upon longer exposure but the expression levels were substantially reduced compared to the levels observed in 293T cells.",

By the addition of an excess of cap analogue to in vitro transcription reactions, usually at a 10:1 or 4:1 ratio of cap analogue to GTP, much of the RNA produced contains a 5\u2032 cap structure (m7G(5\u2032)pppG(pN)). However, at best capping efficiencies of 75\u201380% can be achieved, with the remaining 20\u201325% of RNA containing a triphosphorylated 5\u2032 end (Meis and Meis, 2007). Another drawback of this approach is that in many transcripts the cap analogue incorporates in the incorrect orientation (G(5\u2032)pppm7G(pN)) and as such the RNA is translated inefficiently (Grudzien et al., 2004; Pasquinelli et al., 1995). Typically, in a transcription reaction in which a 4:1 ratio of cap analogue to GTP is used, approximately 80% of transcripts are capped, of which only 60% have incorporated the cap in the correct orientation. The use of anti-reverse cap analogues (ARCA) can overcome some of these limitations as due to the lack of one of the 3\u2032 OH groups, incorporation can occur in the correct orientation only (Grudzien et al., 2004; Stepinski et al., 2001). However, it is impossible to obtain 100% capping efficiencies and therefore some RNA prepared in this manner remains uncapped possessing a triphosphorylated 5\u2032 end.",

Hence, the use of capped in vitro synthesised viral RNA as a possible approach to reverse genetics is not only limited by the inability of some of the RNA to translate efficiently as a result of either the absence of a 5\u2032 cap or an incorrectly incorporated 5\u2032 cap, but also by the induction of interferon by those transcripts which are not capped. Given the reported sensitivity of murine norovirus to the interferon response (Changotra et al., 2009; Karst et al., 2003; Mumphrey et al., 2007), any induction of the interferon response is likely to result in a significant reduction in virus yield. Studies have also reported that the MNV genome possesses base-paired RNA structures at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genomic RNA (Simmonds et al., 2008), hence, although not directly assayed in the current report, transfection of 5\u2032 triphosphorylated MNV will inevitably result in interferon induction. Recent work has highlighted how type I and type II interferon can have a dramatic effect on MNV protein synthesis (Changotra et al., 2009).",

The 5\u2032 end of in vitro transcribed RNA is converted into a cap 0 structure post-transcriptionally, with efficiencies which approach 100% (Meis and Meis, 2007). RNA produced in this manner typically translate with a >5-fold increased efficiency in cells compared to RNA generated using traditional cap analogue or >3-fold greater efficiency than RNA produced using ARCA cap analogues (Meis and Meis, 2007). It is worth noting that by virtue of the mechanism of action of the enzymatic capping reaction, RNA produced in this manner will contain two 5\u2032 G residues at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome rather than 1 i.e. m7GpppGpU. Whilst it is likely that this additional non-viral methylated G at the 5\u2032 end may reduce the infectivity of the RNA, this may at least partially be compensated for by the lack of (or reduced) interferon induction achieved by transfection of RNA prepared in this manner.",

This approach may therefore be of use in quantifying the effect of specific mutations in viral proteins or RNA structures within the norovirus genome as virus yield would be the direct result of a single round of virus replication only. Transfection of synthetic capped genomic RNA resulted in yields of >4.5 \u00d7 105 per 35 mm dish (1.5 \u00d7 106 cells) (Fig. 2).

Optimized transfection conditions were determined using the Neon transfection system from Invitrogen (Fig. 3). In contrast to the majority of electroporation systems which use a cuvette based chamber, the Neon transfection system is based on the use of a pipette tip chamber which produces a more uniform electric field, resulting in higher cell viability (Kim et al., 2008). Using this system, transfection efficiencies of >95% were achieved and optimal condition for the recovery of MNV determined (Fig. 3A). Transfection of >1 \u03bcg of RNA resulted in substantial cytopathic effect at early times post-transfection, with reduced viral yield (Fig. 4). The observed increased cytopathic effect is most likely due the substantial over-expression of the viral proteins, prior to viral RNA replication, which resulted in premature cell death and reduced virus yield. In contrast, transfection of \u223c1 \u03bcg of capped viral RNA resulted in >109 TCID50 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 5), comparable to titres obtained following virus infection. Interestingly, as observed in 293T and BSR-T7 cells, co-transfection of the viral subgenomic RNA did not result in increased virus yield and in most cases produced substantially lower virus yields (data not shown).",
