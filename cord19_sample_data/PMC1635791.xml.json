Similarly, immature oligodendrocyte lineage cells persist in the adult human CNS and may proliferate to increase in number within and near MS lesions (8, 9). However, these immature cells often fail to differentiate sufficiently to remyelinate throughout the extent of MS lesions. Therefore, the repair capacity of endogenous cells may be limited by nonpermissive signals in chronic MS lesions.",

Among these potential signaling molecules, we have examined the in vivo role of endogenous fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which is upregulated during postnatal development and in acute demyelination (10-12). During remyelination after acute demyelination, FGF2 null mice exhibit enhanced oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions (12). This improved oligodendrocyte regeneration was further studied using in vivo retroviral lineage analysis in wild-type versus FGF2 null mice, which demonstrated that the predominant effect of FGF2 in vivo during remyelination is inhibition of OP differentiation (11).",

Cuprizone reproducibly demyelinates the corpus callosum of mice (13). Spontaneous remyelination is greatly reduced after chronic cuprizone demyelination in contrast to acute demyelination (14-16). Importantly, after chronic cuprizone demyelination, axons remain viable and can be remyelinated by transplanted OP cells (16). In this chronic demyelination model, the current study demonstrates dramatically improved remyelination by endogenous cells in mice with genetic deletion of FGF2 as compared with wild-type mice. Thus, FGF2 expression in chronic lesions may limit remyelination and attenuation of FGF2 may generate a sufficiently permissive environment for spontaneous remyelination by endogenous cells.",

After 12 weeks of continuous cuprizone, the oligodendrocyte density continued to be severely reduced relative to values from nontreated mice. Ongoing partial regeneration during chronic demyelination was indicated by the fact that the oligodendrocyte density after 12 weeks was higher than after the initial 3 weeks. After ending the chronic cuprizone treatment, this oligodendrocyte regeneration improved during the recovery period. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 1, remyelination did not progress similarly during this 6-week recovery period. The PLP mRNA in situ hybridization used to identify oligodendrocytes should detect both premyelinating and myelinating oligodendrocytes because PLP transcription precedes myelin formation (25).

In response to the initial episode of acute demyelination, the OP population was amplified almost fourfold (Fig. 3). However, by the end of the chronic demyelination period, the OP density was greatly reduced and remained low during the recovery period. In the chronic lesions, similar results were observed with OP identification using PDGF\u03b1R (Fig. 3A) and using NG2 (12 weeks cuprizone = 155 cells/mm2, n = 5; 12 weeks cuprizone plus 3 weeks recovery =169 cells/mm2, n = 6; 12 weeks cuprizone plus 6 weeks recovery = 115 cells/mm2, n = 5). At 12 weeks of cuprizone treatment, very few cells in the corpus callosum were identified as actively undergoing mitosis using DAPI counterstaining to reveal mitotic chromatin figures, but each actively dividing cell was also immunostained for NG2 (inset, Fig. 3A). Immunostaining for Ki-67 nuclear antigen was used to more broadly identify actively cycling cells within the corpus callosum (Fig. 3B). Ki-67-labeled cycling cells were present at less than half the density of OP cells. This cycling population, although still relatively small, was significantly increased within the corpus callosum of mice fed cuprizone for 12 weeks as compared with age-matched controls or with mice that had recovered for 6 weeks after chronic demyelination. Together, these findings demonstrated compromised but continued OP cycling and regeneration of oligodendrocytes during chronic demyelination and the subsequent recovery period (Figs. 2, 3).",

However, the OP population was depleted during chronic demyelination in contrast to the amplified OP response to acute demyelination in C57Bl/6 (Fig. 3). Therefore, we examined the effect of FGF2 genotype on the density of OP cells and cycling cells in the corpus callosum after chronic demyelination. FGF2 genotype did not appear to alter the OP population dynamics of chronically demyelinated mice or age-matched nonlesioned mice (Fig. 7). The density of OP cells, identified by in situ hybridization for PDGF\u03b1R mRNA, was similar in FGF2+/+ mice and FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7A). Somewhat unexpectedly, mice of both FGF2 null and wild-type genotypes, which are on a 129 Sv-Ev:Black Swiss genetic background, exhibited an increase in OP cell density after 12 weeks of cuprizone that was not observed in C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 3A). This strain difference in OP accumulation after chronic demyelination corresponded with fewer oligodendrocytes observed during the recovery period in FGF2+/+ mice (Fig. 6) as compared with C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 2). Therefore, the FGF2 background appears to be even less favorable than the C57Bl/6 background for OP differentiation and oligodendrocyte regeneration, yet the detrimental effects of the chronic lesion environment can still be overcome in the FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

The density of cells immunolabeled for Ki-67 nuclear antigen increased in chronically lesioned corpus callosum with a return to nonlesioned levels during the recovery phase. The density of endogenous cells that were proliferating in the corpus callosum of FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice was similar to the values for FGF2+/+ mice (Fig. 7(B) and for C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 3). The similarity of FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice and FGF2+/+ mice in our analysis of OP cells and cycling cells indicates that the dramatic differences observed in oligodendrocytes and remyelination may result from a permissive effect of FGF2 removal on OP differentiation into remyelinating oligodendrocytes.",

However, remyelination typically fails with recurring or chronic myelin damage. The current studies show the advantages of the cuprizone model of chronic demyelination for focusing on this compromised repair response. Importantly, our analysis in FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrates that it is possible to overcome chronic lesion effects on endogenous oligodendrocyte lineage cells to increase remyelination. More specifically, taken together with our previous work (11, 12), our findings in FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice indicate that removing FGF2 inhibition of OP differentiation promotes spontaneous remyelination from a depleted pool of endogenous progenitors that persists after chronic demyelination.",

To take further advantage of this model for examining mechanisms to promote remyelination from endogenous cells, we have further characterized the endogenous oligodendrocyte lineage population responses during the recovery period. We used C57Bl/6 mice for this part of our study to facilitate comparison with other studies, because differences in mouse strain can influence the response to cuprizone as well as overall cellular responses to CNS injury (13, 27). After a transient episode of demyelination from 6 weeks of cuprizone ingestion, spontaneous remyelination is effective throughout the corpus callosum. In contrast, after a prolonged period of demyelination, from 12 weeks of continuous cuprizone, the remyelination remains limited and does not progress during a recovery interval that was examined out to 6 weeks. This limited remyelination corresponds with depletion of the OP pool (16 current study). However, the number of oligodendrocytes increases somewhat during the recovery period without a corresponding increase in remyelination of the corpus callosum. Taken together, these findings indicate that the depleted OP pool has a limited capacity to generate oligodendrocytes, and available OP cells may fail to fully differentiate into remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the environment of a chronic lesion. In lesions of some MS cases, immature oligodendrocyte progenitors and premyelinating oligodendrocytes may be present in relatively normal densities without efficiently remyelinating (9, 28). Therefore, further studies will be important for better understanding regulation of the OP pool size and the transition of OP cells into premyelinating and then myelinating oligodendrocytes.",

Crossing these PDGF\u03b1R heterozygous mice to FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice actually increased oligodendroglial repopulation of lesions after acute cuprizone demyelination (11).

In our current analysis, the densities of OP cells and Ki-67-immunolabeled cells were similar between FGF2 wild-type and null genotypes. These results are consistent with our previous BrdU incorporation studies indicating that endogenous FGF2 is not a predominant mitogen for OPs in the acute cuprizone model (11). However, subtle changes in the proliferation rate among an asymmetrically dividing OP pool could be relatively difficult to detect in a small population of cells over a prolonged disease and recovery course. FGF2 is also predicted to stimulate neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) to contribute to repopulation of corpus callosum lesions (34). During the prolonged demyelination period of the current study, the contribution of cells derived from the SVZ should have been evident in the dynamics of the OP pool in the corpus callosum. The lack of a detrimental effect of FGF2 absence on the OP pool may indicate that FGF2 effects on the SVZ cells may not be a significant contribution to the remyelination of the overlying corpus callosum. However, more direct analysis of the response of cells in the SVZ is required to make this determination. In addition, endogenous elevation of FGF2 in lesions may elicit specific effects that are not replicated with in vivo methods of elevating exogenous FGF2 levels (34-37).",

In contrast to this expected protective effect of FGF2 on neurons, removal of endogenous FGF2 actually improved regenerative parameters in lesions that involved remyelination. Improved regeneration of oligodendrocytes was observed in FGF2\u2212/\u2212 mice after acute cuprizone demyelination of the corpus callosum and after murine hepatitis virus strain A59 demyelination of spinal cord (11, 12 current study). In an example from the peripheral nervous system, FGF2 knockout mice were used to prevent the normal upregulation of FGF2 and FGF receptor (FGFR) activation associated with Schwann cells and macrophages at a site of sciatic nerve crush injury (40). Compared with wild-type mice, the FGF2 knockout mice exhibited improved myelination and increased axon diameter during regeneration from sciatic nerve crush (40). These results indicate that a detrimental effect of endogenous FGF2 on remyelination may outweigh FGF2 protection from acute axon damage in these lesion models. Indeed, the improved remyelination in nerves of the FGF2 knockout mice may provide significant protection of axons from damage subsequent to the initial crush injury. Correlative support for a similar role of FGF2 in a chronic autoimmune model of MS can be found in a study of neural stem cell transplantation improved into mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (41). The transplanted mice exhibited improved remyelination, with a major contribution from endogenous cells, and had less axonal loss in lesion areas. Neural stem cell transplantation was also associated with a significant decrease in FGF2 expression and reduced astroglial scar formation in the EAE lesions. FGF2 levels may modulate scar formation in demyelinated lesions because expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 corresponds with scarring, but not nonscarring, astroglial responses after other forms of CNS injury (42).",

Differential effects of FGF2 at different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage may occur through differential expression and activation of FGFR isoforms (43). Oligodendrocyte lineage cell expression of high-affinity FGFRs and coreceptors varies with developmental stage and FGF2 exposure (44). Furthermore, expression of multiple FGFR types is significantly increased in response to demyelination (19). FGF2 may also have differential effects based on changing interactions with other signaling pathways that regulate oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation and myelination such as Notch1 (45, 46) and neuregulin (47, 48). Interpreting a direct effect of FGF2 is complicated because neurons and glial cells express multiple FGFR types within and near demyelinated lesions (19). Therefore, future studies will be required to identify the specific signaling components mediating endogenous FGF2 signaling in the in vivo context of demyelination and remyelination.",

            "text": "In MS lesions, the pathology is heterogeneous and the effect on the oligodendrocyte lineage population varies dramatically (49). Oligodendrocyte density is severely compromised in demyelinated lesions in some patients with MS. Further studies are imperative to optimize regenerative responses from immature oligodendrocyte lineage cell populations that have been observed in some MS lesions (9, 28). Targeting inhibitory signals that are upregulated in lesions should be a viable strategy for therapeutics to promote differentiation as needed near lesions. FGF2 expression has been reported in reactive astrocytes of acute and chronic MS plaques (50). In addition, in cultures from adult human brain white matter, FGF2 inhibited the differentiation of preoligodendrocytes into oligodendrocytes (51). Strategies to promote remyelination by attenuating FGF2 inhibition of OP differentiation may take advantage of reagents to modulate FGF2 signaling, which are currently being developed for angiogenesis and cancer treatments. In our in vivo analysis, absence of FGF2 was not detrimental in the normal adult or throughout the disease process. Therefore, inhibition of FGF2 signaling may be acceptable across demyelinating disease stages, which would improve treatment feasibility in diseases such as MS that have an unstable disease course. Treatments to promote remyelination should be a valuable complement to strategies that abrogate ongoing causes of demyelination such as immunomodulatory therapies.",
