Domain I is an eight-stranded \u03b2-barrel7,8,9 that participates in the conformational changes associated with the acidification in the endosome10. Domain II contains 12 \u03b2-strands and has roles in dimerization, trimerization and fusion7,8,10. Domain III (DIII) adopts an immunoglobulin-like fold, and contains surfaced-exposed loops in the mature virion11,12, which putatively have a role in receptor attachment6,8,13,14.

Although human \u03b3-globulin has potential as an immunotherapy for WNV infection, it has several limitations: (i) it is derived from nonimmune and immune donors and has only a modest specific neutralizing titer5; (ii) batch variability may affect the efficacy of specific preparations; and (iii) as a human blood product, it has an inherent risk of transmitting infectious agents. To overcome these limitations, we developed a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies against WNV and determined the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potency as a guide for identifying candidates for humanization.",

Samples from convalescent individuals were negative for WNV RNA but positive for neutralizing WNV-specific antibodies.

To determine whether these samples contained antibodies that localized to the neutralizing epitope on DIII, we tested whether E16 Fab or IgG could compete binding to recombinant, wild-type and mutant N394K and K307N forms of DIII (Supplementary Fig. 2 online); N394K retains wild-type binding to E16, whereas K307N has markedly reduced binding. E16 equivalently inhibited binding of patient WNV-specific antibodies to wild-type (Fab, 35% \u00b1 8; IgG, 40% \u00b1 12) or N394K DIII (Fab, 32% \u00b1 9; IgG, 34% \u00b1 11), whereas E53 IgG, a WNV-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope outside DIII, did not compete binding to wild-type (1% \u00b1 4) or N394K (\u22122% \u00b1 5) DIII. As expected, E16, which only weakly recognizes K307N, poorly competed (Fab 6% \u00b1 3; IgG 9% \u00b1 4) binding to K307N DIII.

E16 recognized the dominant epitope and neutralized all strains that were tested. Sequence analysis of 124 WNV strains in public databases showed almost complete (98.4\u2013100%) conservation of the contact residues S306, K307, T330 and T332. Only two clinically attenuated lineage II isolates had mutations at these residues. Because of the structural homology among flaviviruses7,8,16, the analogous amino acids that map to the distal lateral surface of DIII can be readily identified. Although this region is highly variable among flaviviruses, most mutations that abolish binding of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies map here15,18,30,31, suggesting the existence of an analogous dominant neutralizing epitope for other flaviviruses.

After cloning into a PET21 vector (Novagen) and sequence confirmation of the mutations, we transformed plasmids into BL21 Codon Plus E. coli cells (Stratagene). Bacteria were grown in Luria broth, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) and pelleted. Subsequently, we lysed bacteria after the addition of lysozyme, sonicated them and recovered DIII as insoluble aggregate from the inclusion bodies. DIII was denatured in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and refolded by slowly diluting out the denaturing reagents in the presence of L-arginine, EDTA, PMSF, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione. We separated refolded DIII from aggregates on a Superdex 75 16/60 size-exclusion column (Amersham Bioscience) and concentrated it using a centricon-10 spin column into 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% NaN3.

At 2 d after WNV infection, mice were passively transferred a single dose (0.8, 4, 20, 100 or 500 \u03bcg) of (a) E16, (b) E24, or (c) E34 monoclonal antibodies. As controls, mice were independently administered saline (PBS) or a negative control monoclonal antibody (anti-SARS ORF7a, 500 \u03bcg). The survival curves were constructed using data from two independent experiments. The number of animals for each antibody dose ranged from 20 to 30. The difference in survival curves was statistically significant for all WNV-specific monoclonal antibody doses shown (P < 0.0001). (d) WNV burden in the brain of 5-week-old wild-type mice. At days 4, 5 and 6 after WNV infection, brains were harvested and viral burdens were determined by plaque assay. The following percentage of mice had viral burdens below detection (<20 PFU/g): day 4, 33%; day 5, 22%; day 6, 17%. (e,f) Efficacy of WNV-specific monoclonal antibody therapy at days 4 (e) and 5 (f) after infection. A single dose (0.5 mg at day 4 or 2 mg at day 5) of monoclonal antibody (E16, E24, E34 or anti-SARS ORF7a) was administered either 4 or 5 d after WNV infection. Data reflect approximately 20 mice per condition. The difference in survival curves was statistically significant for all WNV-specific monoclonal antibody doses shown at day 4 (P < 0.0001) and day 5 (E16, P = 0.0009; E24, P = 0.027). (g) Effect of E16 therapy on viral burden. Mice were treated with 2 mg of E16 or PBS on day 5 after WNV infection. On day 9, brains were recovered, homogenized and subjected to plaque assay. For a subset (6) that received PBS treatment, brains were harvested at days 7 and 8 from moribund mice. The data is expressed as PFU/g. Of 16 mice treated with E16 68% (11) had undetectable viral loads in the brain at day 9 whereas all mice (14 of 14) treated with PBS had detectable virus at the time of harvest. The dotted line represents the limit of sensitivity of the assay and the dark bars represent the mean of the log values. The differences were statistically different (P < 0.0001).",

(c) Binding curves and kinetic parameters of DIII binding to chimeric and humanized E16. One representative surface plasmon resonance experiment for Hm-E16.3 is shown. (d) Neutralization studies with different E16 antibodies. Neutralizing activity was determined by a PRNT assay. The indicated amount of mouse, humanized, chimerized or aglycosyl chimerized E16 were mixed with WNV before addition to BHK-21 cells. Samples were performed in duplicate and the experiment is one representative of three. (e) Therapeutic activity of Ch-E16 and aglycosyl Ch-E16. At 2 d after WNV infection, mice were passively transferred saline or a single intraperitoneal inoculation of increasing doses (4, 20 or 100 \u03bcg) of Ch-E16 or aglycosyl Ch-E16 N297Q that differs by a single amino acid. The survival curves were constructed using data from two independent experiments with 13 mice for each arm. At the 4 \u03bcg dose, the survival difference between Ch-E16 and aglycosyl Ch-E16 was statistically different (P = 0.008). (f) Therapeutic activity of Hm-E16 in wild-type mice. At 2 d after WNV infection, mice were passively transferred saline, or a single dose (4, 20 or 100 \u03bcg) of three versions of humanized E16 (16.1, 16.2 or 16.3).
