Past and present pandemics such as the Asian flu (1957, H2N2), the Hong Kong flu (1968, H3N2) and the recent swine flu (2009, H1N1) outbreaks have demonstrated the extent to which the virus can be transmitted swiftly on a global scale (Cox & Subbarao 2000; Fraser et al. 2009). In the case of the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, although the H1N1 strain is not as lethal as originally thought, there are fears that a deadlier strain may emerge, sparking off the next wave of health crisis. This is in addition to the existing threat of the highly lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus (Hatta et al. 2001) mutating into a human-transmissible variant (Hatta & Kawaoka 2002).",

However, due to limited medicine stockpiles and resources, policies must be made such that they optimize the drug usage while minimizing the cost and economic impact of the intervention strategies. Since it is not possible to experimentally assess the overall effectiveness of the various pandemic control strategies, mathematical models play a major role as they allow us to address such issues through simulations. Notable past works include examining how to contain a novel influenza strain at its source (Ferguson et al. 2005; Longini et al. 2005), and failing that, how we can limit its impact within the population (Ferguson et al. 2006; Germann et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006; Nu\u00f1o et al. 2007).",

Non-pharmaceutical measures such as quarantine and contact tracing can then be activated, thus maximizing the probability of containment (Ferguson et al. 2005; Longini et al. 2005). Even in the event of an ongoing outbreak, it was found that early detection and intervention can help mitigate the spread of influenza. For instance, studies have revealed that during the 1918 flu pandemic, cities in the United States that enforced early interventions had significantly reduced mortality rate (Hatchett et al. 2007). Furthermore, during a pandemic, various influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), as well as non-pandemic seasonal influenza cases will continue to present themselves within the population. The ability to differentiate between the pathogenic strains and the less harmful ones can help channel antiviral drugs to where they are needed. Such targeted treatment is invaluable in the face of limited drug supplies, especially in developing countries.",

These factors will impact the intervention policies that should be made during an outbreak. It has been argued that a slow, low throughput laboratory-based diagnostic test, such as immunofluorescence DFA antibody staining and RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction), may not be able to effectively assist pandemic mitigation (Wu et al. 2006). Ideally, a rapid PCR-based diagnostic testkit should be able to detect the relevant virus in less than 30 minutes, requiring nothing more than a patient sample, and a portable device to perform extraction and drive the PCR cycle. This permits testing to be done quickly, outside a laboratory setting, and allows diagnosis to be performed more easily in rural areas, where novel influenza is likely to emerge. However, such testkits require time to develop for novel strains, and may not be available during the initial phases of a pandemic, during which one may have to fall back on conventional laboratory-based approaches.",

However, previous works on pandemic modelling either treat ILIs as false positives that consume resources, or assume perfect diagnosis without accounting for the costs associated with the use of the different diagnostic techniques. In this work, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of various intervention policies when implemented with different diagnostic methods. Specifically, we want to address the following questions\u2014Is a fast and accurate testkit necessary in mitigating the spread of an ongoing pandemic? In addition, are there any other dominating factors that should be given due consideration in forming pandemic mitigation policies? To do so, we developed a stochastic agent-based epidemic framework and implemented it on a small city-scale model, typified by developed countries such as Singapore and the United States. The impact of testkits when used in the context of different intervention policies is then assessed by comparing the severity of the outbreak with an aggregate cost function which encompasses the various costs and resources involved.",

Since such parameters are not readily available for novel variants, we referred to the natural history of typical influenza viruses, adapting the values from previous works whenever possible. The basic function describing the dynamics of transmission is the instantaneous force of infection experienced by the ith individual, and it is summarized by the following equation:\n2.1\nwhere X and K are the sets of people and locations in the city, respectively; \u03b2k is the transmission coefficient associated with a particular location type. The transmission coefficients are estimated such that without any forms of intervention, the proportions of transmissions within the household (PH), workplace (PW) and community (PC) are approximately 30, 37 and 33 per cent, respectively (Ferguson et al. 2006). This proportion is location-dependent, and the values we followed are reported to be estimated based on data from the United States. Using our transmission coefficients (\u03b2h = 1.89 \u00d7 10\u22121 h\u22121, \u03b2w = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22121 h\u22121 and \u03b2c = 6.51 \u00d7 10\u22123 h\u22121) the transmission proportions in the model are computed to be PH = 30.7 per cent, PW = 35.6 per cent and PC = 33.7 per cent. \u0393ijk is a proximity function for two individuals xi, xj and location k at a particular time instance. In the model, the function will give 3 if xi and xj are in the same sub-location and 1 if they are in the same location, but different sub-locations. Otherwise it returns 0. Ij and Si are parameters that describe the infectiousness of xj and the susceptibility of xi, respectively. The probability of a person getting infected is then given by p(Infectedi) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bbi \u0394t).

Hence, given the reported mean lengths of the exposed (1.2 days), pre-symptomatic (0.7 days) and infectious phase (4.1 days), in the model we divided them into 5, 3 and 17 substages, respectively. Simulating the model 20 000 times without any forms of intervention policies or diagnostic approaches gave us an average of 29 h for the exposed phase, 17 h for the pre-symptomatic phase, and 98.5 h for the infectious phase. Assuming that the total duration of infection follows a normal distribution, we computed the mean length to be 144.5 h and a standard deviation of 6.13 h.",

Of those who are symptomatic, 6 per cent are assumed critical and require hospitalization (Wu et al. 2006). The other 94 per cent will show only mild symptoms. For the critically ill, they are 50 per cent more infectious as compared with those showing mild symptoms, while the asymptomatic cases are 50 per cent less infectious. In the current model, we ignored the occurrence of deaths. However, it can be assumed that the death rate is directly proportional to the total attack rate. For each individual, the susceptibility is assumed to be constant (unless the person is on medication, or immunized against the disease). However, the infectiousness (for a mildly symptomatic person) follows a baseline profile as shown in figure 1b. Both the susceptibility and infectiousness can be modified by the consumption of antiviral drugs. While an infected person is on medication, his/her infectiousness is reduced by 60 per cent. On the other hand, the susceptibility of an uninfected person will be reduced by 30 per cent. In addition, the probability of symptoms appearing will be reduced to a minimum of 23.45 per cent depending on the length of medication. Being on medication also shortens the duration of the disease by a maximum of 25 h if the consumption of drugs is sustained throughout the course of infection. Finally, once a person has recovered from the disease, he/she is assumed to be immune to further infection, and we set the susceptibility to 0 (see the electronic supplementary material for more details).",

If the contact becomes symptomatic later on and is subsequently diagnosed with pandemic flu, he/she will only be issued enough drugs to top-up his/her current supply to the required dosage levels as per index cases.

One would expect that with more people visiting the hospital, the amount of drug and testkit usage will increase as well. However, the contrary is observed for some cases, particularly for policies P4a and P4c. Under these policies, the total attack rate can drop by as much as 28.4 per cent as the compliance rates increase from 50 to 70 per cent (policy P4c, diagnosis approach D2), and instead of seeing an increase in the medicine consumption, we get a decrease by 2.3 per cent (figure 8). Similar patterns are observed when other diagnostic approaches are implemented in tandem with P4a and P4c. We noted that the reversal of the correlation between total attack rate and cost occurs only in the presence of two conditions: (i) full contact tracing and (ii) prophylaxis of the contacts. Additionally, a high diagnosis compliance rate can be loosely associated with a lower false negative rate for viral detection. Hence, we expect measures that reduce the false negative rate to have a more significant impact on pandemic mitigation when implemented with the abovementioned conditions. The critical issue that follows is then how limited resources such as antiviral drugs and testkits can be used effectively with those conditions.",

One reason for this phenomenon is that the force of infection experienced by an ONILI patient is increased dramatically, not only because they visit the same hospital as infected individuals, but also due to the higher concentration of infectious people in the hospitals as compared with other location types. In fact, in the absence of a fast testkit, simulations showed that it is better to collect the samples from the patient and allow him/her to go off while diagnosis is being performed using conventional laboratory-based methods.

Then why is a fast testkit necessary? In the current model, the implementations of diagnostic methods and intervention policies are homogeneous, i.e. assume pandemic positive, slow and fast testkits are not being used in a way such that their intended effects are maximized according to whether the individual is an index case or a contact. In general, we find that three of the most important factors that guide the use of diagnostic testkits are (i) the resource consumption by false positives, (ii) the frequency of false positives, and (iii) the propagation potential of false negatives.",

This is especially true for antiviral drugs, which often represents a hard constraint. Depending on the frequency and proportion of such false positives, proper diagnostic approaches can then be implemented. For instance, when the proportion of false positives is high, such as the case of a high ILI rate, assuming that all patients are pandemic positive would put a strain on the limited drug supplies. Of course, such rates may not be possible to obtain for a novel pandemic strain with no outbreak history. Nonetheless, by not advocating a blanket approach and instead, identifying areas where false positives are most likely to occur, the proper use of fast testkits can possibly achieve better mitigation outcomes and minimizing wastage.",

As such, it may be more prudent to assume positive and administer antiviral drugs without diagnosis. However, a different approach may be adopted for their contacts. From figure 5a, there is a significant increase in the amount of drugs being used when the tracing of all contacts is in place (except for policy P4b). Policy P4a uses almost 5 times more drugs than policy P2a despite reducing the total attack rate by only slightly more than half. This suggests that there is a huge amount of wastage due to the contacts. Hence, instead of applying prophylaxis to the contacts, using diagnostic testkits to identify infected contacts and treating them with antiviral drugs might then possibly yield a better attack rate-to-drug usage ratio. The question then remains as to whether a fast or slow testkit makes a difference to the attack rate and drug usage. Assuming that the contacts need not go to the hospital and instead a respiratory specimen is collected and sent for analysis while the contact is ordered to stay at home (a diagnostic approach similar to D4), then a fast testkit may not be required. However, if a trip to the hospital is needed for diagnosis, the availability of a fast testkit may minimize the time the contact spends not under quarantine, preventing further spread of the influenza virus.",

In figure 4, the total attack and peak attack rates for non-treatment are shown as base lines. For a moderately infectious variant as simulated in our model, an untreated case may not spread the virus in an exponential manner. As such, a testkit may be used to reduce drug wastage, but a highly sensitive one may not be required since the infectiousness of the individual is limited. However, for the more transmissible cases, such as the ongoing H1N1 swine flu outbreak (at the time of writing; Neumann et al. 2009; Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team 2009), it may be unwise to leave a potentially infectious person untreated. If a sensitive testkit is not yet available, then assuming that a symptomatic individual has contracted the pandemic virus is probably more efficient in bringing down the attack rates. Aside from the transmissibility of the virus, geographical features may also affect the propagation potential of a false negative. In urban areas such as cities, where close contact due to work and public transport is inevitable, a single untreated case can rapidly lead to the formation and spread of influenza clusters.",

Public transport such as buses and subways not only facilitates the displacement of carriers between locations within the city, it also brings several individuals into close proximity, increasing the likelihood of the virus infecting several other people. A limitation of current diagnostic measures in most countries is that a symptomatic person has to travel to a local hospital for testing, which requires commuting, mostly on public transport. As mentioned previously, it is possible for a symptomatic individual to either send a respiratory specimen to the hospital, or request for a fast testkit for diagnosis at home, hence alleviating the need for public transport. Both measures can potentially reduce the risk of exposure to others significantly.",

In the event where a fast and accurate testkit is not yet available, one has to rely on slower testkits, coupling their use with effective social distancing measures to minimize the wastage of antiviral drugs. In this work, we have developed a stochastic agent-based pandemic model to assess the necessity of a fast testkit. From our simulation results, we showed that intervention policies, and not testkits, are the key means to successfully contain an outbreak, and that casting a wider net for contact tracing is crucial for minimizing the total attack rate. However, although not yet included in our model, we can infer from the results that most of the drug wastage is due to prophylaxis being administered to the contacts. Considering the use of testkits on the contacts may be a better resource allocation strategy. Within each intervention policy, the use of slower testkits while holding the individual at the hospital can be an equally effective means of mitigating a pandemic outbreak as compared with a fast testkit. However, this is provided that proper infection controls, such as a hospital segregation policy, are in place. Otherwise, hospital transmission may limit the usefulness of other efforts such as contact tracing and quarantine orders.",
