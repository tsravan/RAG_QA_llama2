            "text": "Analyses of a growing number of high resolution ribosome structures coupled with kinetic studies are revealing that the ribosome is highly dynamic, capable of assuming >40 different conformational states through the translation elongation cycle [reviewed in (1)]. Thus, a critical question is how the ribosome coordinates all of these states to ensure the directionality and fidelity of protein synthesis. The general answer lies in allostery: the formation and breaking of specific intermolecular contacts in response to different ligand binding states serves as a series of switches to ensure that the ribosome is optimally configured to proceed to the next functional state. The current challenge is to identify and functionally map the specific allosteric switching components.",

For example, biochemical approaches have been employed to define the kinetic parameters governing every step of the elongation cycle, revealing that selection of the appropriate aminoacyl\u2013tRNA (aa-tRNA) depends on a two step kinetic process [reviewed in (2)]. Biophysical methods have revealed that conformational switching by rRNA and ribosomal protein L1 ensures exit of deacylated tRNA from the ribosome (1,3), while real time single molecule fluorescence and force measurements are revealing dynamic motions of the ribosome and tRNAs, and directly probing the forces stabilizing ribosomal complexes [reviewed in (4)]. Biochemical, computational and high resolution structural methods have been employed to map changes in rRNA structures during the transit of tRNAs through the ribosome and during the peptidyltransfer reaction (5\u201310). Pertinent to this study, we have previously used a combination of molecular genetics, biochemical and biophysical approaches to identify the contributions of specific ribosomal proteins and rRNA bases involved in coordinating the stepwise process of accommodation of aa-tRNA into the ribosomal A-site, activation of the peptidyltransferase center, and recruitment of the trans-acting translocase (EF-G in bacteria, eEF2 in eukaryotes) using yeast ribosomes as a model (11\u201316).",

            "text": "Ribosomal protein L3 in particular appears to have an important function in this process. Figure 1A shows L3 within the context of the large ribosomal subunit (LSU), including the following structural and functional elements; the peptidyltransferase center (PTC), the aa-tRNA accommodation corridor which lies in between Helix 89 and the complex Helix 90\u201392 structure, Helix 95 (the Sarcin/Ricin Loop or SRL), and the GTPase-associated center (GAC). The latter two structures interact with the eEF1A\u2013aa-tRNA\u2013GTP ternary complex and eEF2 (the eukaryotic translation elongation factor homologs of bacterial EF\u2013Tu-aa-tRNA\u2013GTP ternary complex and EF-G, respectively). The 3D rendering in Figure 1B shows that L3 contains a globular domain that interfaces with the solvent side of the LSU, and two structures, the N-terminal extension and a central loop that extend deep into the central core of the LSU. The central loop can be subdivided into two domains, the \u2018tryptophan finger\u2019 (W-finger) positioned at the tip of the central extension, and a cluster of basic amino acids that protrudes from the center of the internal loop like a thumb roughly perpendicular to the W-finger that we call the L3 \u2018basic thumb\u2019. Figure 1C shows that this basic thumb is nestled in the core of a cagelike structure formed by elements of three different 25S rRNA helices: H61, H73 and H90. We previously proposed a \u2018rocker switch\u2019 model describing how structural rearrangements of the N-terminal extension and the W-finger of L3 function to coordinate the stepwise processes of translation elongation (17). Missing from the prior analyses was an explanation of how the movements of these extensions of L3 are communicated to functional centers of the ribosome. In this current study, analysis of the basic thumb of L3 illuminates this question. Mutagenesis of the indicated amino acids to alanines followed by genetic, biochemical and structural analyses suggests that the basic thumb acts as a molecular clamp to play a role in allosterically communicating the ribosome's tRNA occupancy status to the elongation factor binding region and the peptidyltransferase center, thus facilitating coordination of their functions through the elongation cycle.\n\n",

After 2\u20133 days at 20\u00b0C, killer activity was scored as a zone of growth inhibition around the Killer+ colonies. To monitor programmed \u22121 frameshifting using the dual luciferase reporter plasmids, glass beads were used to prepare lysates from cells expressing the 0-frame, \u22121 (L-A derived), or +1 (Ty1 derived) dual luciferase plasmids (20). After clarification of the lysates by centrifugation, typically 5 \u03bcl was used in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl of dual luciferase assay reagents (Promega, Madison WI, USA), and Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were quantitated using a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Frameshifting efficiencies were calculated by dividing the firefly/Renilla luminescence ratios from lysates of cells expressing the PRF test reporters by the same ratio obtained from lysates of cells expressing the zero-frame control reporter. All assays were replicated enough times to achieve >95% confidence levels, and statistical analyses were performed as described earlier (21).",

[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe was eluted using a programmed binary gradient of buffers A and B. Elution of aa-tRNA was monitored by OD260 readings, and [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe concentrations and specific activities were determined. The presence of aa-tRNA in the eluted material was confirmed by TLC (24). Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe was obtained in a similar manner.

Complexes were purified from free Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe by centrifugation through a glycerol cushion (0.5 ml; 20% glycerol in binding buffer by centrifugation at 50 000 rpm for 2 h in MLS 50 rotor). Ribosome pellets were rinsed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer and suspended in 1.15 ml of binding buffer. For puromycin reactions, 1.15 ml of complex C extract was pre-incubated at 30\u00b0C for 5 min, and reactions were initiated by adding pH neutralized puromycin (100 mM stock) to final concentrations of 10 mM. Aliquots of 100 \u03bcl were removed, and reactions were terminated at the indicated time intervals by addition of 100 \u03bcl of 1.0 N NaOH. Reaction products were extracted with 0.4 ml of ethyl acetate, 0.2 ml of organic phase was transferred to scintillation vials, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. A 50-\u03bcl aliquot of initial reaction mixture was also transferred to scintillation vials, and total radioactivity (No) was determined. Controls without puromycin were included in each experiment, and the values obtained were subtracted as background. The percent of the bound Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe converted to Ac-[14C]Phe-puromycin was corrected with the extent factor \u03b1 (determined if complex C were allowed to react for 1 h; Co = \u03b1No), as described earlier (27,28). The reaction plots were fit to a first-order exponential equation, and values of Kobs (the apparent rate constant of entire course of reaction at a given concentration of puromycin) were calculated by using Graphpad Prism software.",

Each preparation of eEF2 showed linear concentration response curves in the range of eEF2 amounts used in binding experiments. For eEF2-binding experiments, reaction mixes (25 \u03bcl) containing 12.5 pmol of salt washed 80S ribosomes and various concentrations of 6xHis-tagged eEF2 in binding buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM ammonium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 100 \u03bcM GDPNP) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Estimation of bound eEF2 was carried out as follows by assuming that ribosome bound eEF2 is not susceptible to ADP-ribosylation by diphtheria toxin (31\u201333). Free (unbound) eEF2 was estimated by ADP-ribosylation of eEF2: 100 pmol [14C] NAD+ and 0.2 \u03bcg of diphtheria toxin were added to each reaction mix and incubated for 30 min at 30\u00b0C. Total eEF2 in each reaction mix was determined by ADP-ribosylation reaction after bound eEF2 was released by adding EDTA to 10 mM. Reaction mixes were precipitated with TCA, and amounts of [14C]ADP-ribosylated eEF2 were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Control values (lacking diphtheria toxin) were subtracted. Ribosome bound eEF2 was calculated by subtracting free values from total amount. Kd values were determined assuming single binding sites using Graphpad Prism software.",

The 4.6-kb dsRNA L-A viral genome encodes the viral coat protein (Gag), and the Gag-pol replicase that is encoded by a programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (\u22121 PRF) (38). The M1 satellite dsRNA is encapsidated and replicated inside of L-A encoded viral particles. The M1 encoded preprotoxin is processed by the Kex1p and Kex2p cellular proteases into the mature secreted toxin. Cells infected by L-A and M1 can kill uninfected cells, but are themselves immune, hence the name \u2018Killer\u2019. The presence of Killer can be easily assayed by replica plating test cells onto a lawn of diploid uninfected (indicator) cells: Killer+ cells will kill the nearby indicator cells, resulting in a ring of growth inhibition around the test cells. One of the first yeast mutants cloned, mak8-1, was first identified by its inability to maintain the Killer phenotype (Mak\u2212 phenotype) and encodes an allele of rpl3 (39). Analyses of the L3 basic thumb mutants revealed that three of the single mutants (K236A, K237A and R247A) were completely unable to maintain the Killer virus, while R232A and R244A had weak Killer phenotypes. None of the double mutants were able to maintain the virus (Figure 2B, summarized in Table 1).",

Consistent with the frameshifting data, all of the L3 basic thumb mutants promoted decreased affinity for aa-tRNA to the A-site (Figure 3A and B, and summarized in Table 1), but did not affect binding of Ac-aa-tRNA to the P-site (Figure 3C and D, summarized in Table 1). Specifically, R232A, which does not directly contact any rRNA bases, had the smallest effect on aa-tRNA binding (Kd values \u223c126 nM compared to \u223c94 nM for wild-type, i.e. 1.4-fold increase), while the K236A and K237A mutants, which participate in only a few rRNA contacts (Figure 4B), had moderate effects (\u223c165 nM each, 1.8-fold wild-type). In contrast, R247A, which contacts both H61 and H90 had a very strong effect on aa-tRNA binding (\u223c300 nM, 3.3-fold wild-type). The double mutants, which also affected multiple rRNA contacts had comparable effects on aa-tRNA binding (from \u223c245 nM to \u223c340 nM).\n\n",

The observed Kobs = 0.34 min\u22121 in wild-type ribosomes (Figure 3G, Table 1) is comparable to similar reactions using E. coli ribosomes and the Ac-Phe-tRNA substrate (44), confirming that these relatively low rates are determined by Ac-Phe-tRNA as a poor substrate for the peptidyltransferase reaction, and thus represent true measurements of peptidyltransferase activity, as opposed to peptidyl-tRNA turnover or other artifacts. The R232A, K236A and R247A mutants all promoted decreased rates of peptidyltransfer to approximately two\u2013thirds of wild-type levels, while the double mutants (K236A/K237A, K236A/R1247A, and R247A/K248A) had stronger effects, decreasing rates to \u223c50% of wild-type (Figure 3G and H, Table 1).

Strikingly, while 2D maps of the LSU suggest that these structural elements are in physically separate domains from one another in (Figure 4B), the 3D structures reveal that the peptidyltransferase center, Helices 73, 90 and 94 are complexly folded to form a roughly Y-shaped topology, while the Helix 61\u201364 loop forms a cagelike structure opposite of this Y, with the L3 basic thumb positioned in the center where all of the basic side chains seem to glue all of the rRNA pieces together (Figures 1C, 4B and C). Importantly, the distal tip of Helix 92 is folded back upon itself where G2922 in the A-loop participates with C2876 and G2951 at the base of H90 to form an A-minor motif in the A-site of the peptidyltransferase center (48).

            "text": "To assess the effects of the viable mutants on rRNA structure, SHAPE [Selective 2\u2032-Hydroxyl Acylation and Primer Extension, (34,49)] using 1M7 [1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride, (50)] was used to probe wild-type and selected mutant ribosomes containing either Ac-aa-tRNAPhe at the P-site alone, or both tRNAPhe and aa-tRNAPhe at the P-and A-sites respectively (Figure 4). Inspection of the results revealed two general trends. First, that the mutants promoted significant changes in rRNA structure in the peptidyltransferase center (U2953, U2955, G2977), along the path taken by aa-tRNA as it accommodates into the LSU (accommodation corridor, G2912, U2924, C2929, A2934), in Helix 94 where it interacts with the globular domain of L3 (G3003, A3006, G3009), and in Helix 95 (U3019, U3023, A3033). Secondly, while the mutants only altered the Helix 73\u2013Helix 95 region when only the P-site was occupied by Ac-aa-tRNA, the majority of changes in the Helix 91\u201393 region were observed when both A- and P-sites were occupied. Detailed analyses reveal that the R247A mutant conferred the largest number of changes in rRNA structure, promoting deprotection of C2985 in Helix 91, G3003, A3006, G3009 in Helix 94, and U3019, U3023 and A3033 in Helix 95 when only the P-site was occupied (Figure 4A and B). In contrast, this mutant promoted increased deprotection of G2912 in Helix 92, U2924 in the A-loop, A2934 in the bulge between Helix 92 and Helix 90, and U2955 in the peptidyltransferase center when the A-site was occupied by aa-tRNA. This mutant also caused hyperprotection of A2987 in Helix 73 when the A-site was occupied. Some of the other mutants had similar effects on some but not all of the same bases, e.g. K237A caused deprotection of G2912 and U2955, and enhanced protection of A2987 when the A-site was occupied. Other mutant specific effects were observed. For example, when only the P-site was occupied K247A promoted enhanced protection of G2977, while both K247A and K236A promoted deprotection of A2995 and U2953 under these conditions (Figure 4A and B). K237A also promoted increased protection from 1M7 at G2977 when both the A- and P-sites were occupied. R232A had significant effects in the 3\u2032 loop between H90 and H92, and in the peptidyltransferase center (U2955). The observation that the bulged A2971 in Helix 93 was generally deprotected when only the P-site was occupied by Ac-aa-tRNAPhe, but became protected from chemical attack upon loading of aa-tRNAPhe into the A-site (Figure 4) serves as an important control, as this site occupancy-specific conformational change has also been observed for bacterial ribosomes (51). Interestingly, this pattern was also observed for A2926 in the A-loop, the possible significance of which is discussed below.",

Although the bulk of the ribosome is comprised of rRNA, and indeed, many of its critical functions are mediated through RNA\u2013RNA interactions, it is clear that protrusions of ribosomal proteins, which can be thought of as loops, hooks and fingers, function to help \u2018switch\u2019 the ribosome between different conformational/functional states. For example, the C-terminal extension of E. coli S13 is thought to help coordinate movement of the peptidyl\u2013tRNA with structural rearrangements at the ribosome interface that are critical for translocation by sampling the tRNA occupancy status at the decoding center (52,53). The N-terminal \u2018hook\u2019 of yeast L10 (E. coli L16) is believed to play an active role to coordinate switching of the ribosome between the pre- and post-translocational states (16). Ribosomal protein L2, which is intimately intertwined with multiple domains of the LSU, is thought to coordinate long range interactions between tRNAs and the ribosome (14). Ribosomal protein L3 is of particular interest because of its function as a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 to the ribosomal A-site (13). A follow-up study suggested that two critical structures of L3, the W-finger and the N-terminal extension, function together as a \u2018rocker switch\u2019 to coordinate LSU associated functions (17). The L3 basic thumb is of interest because it appears to provide the structural link in this rocker switch mechanism. Protruding roughly perpendicular from the L3 W-finger toward the intersubunit face of the LSU, it is surrounded by a cagelike structure formed by a large bulge framed between Helices H61\u201364, Helix 73, Helix 90 and Helix 94. It is in the center of a nexus connecting the W-finger with the L3 globular domain, the peptidyltransferase center, the aa-tRNA accommodation corridor, and the SRL. Furthermore, it is proximal to the B5 intersubunit bridge, which involves multiple contacts involving bases in Helices 62 and 64 (54).",

            "text": "Unlike the small subunit (SSU), where the four rRNA domains are largely physically distinct, the six rRNA domains of the LSU are highly intertwined (54). With regard to the current study, the loop bounded by Helices 61\u201364 lie in domain IV, the PTC and Helices 90\u201393 and Helix 73 are in domain V, and Helices 94 and 95 are in domain IV. Previously, we demonstrated that the conformationally dynamic nature of the W-finger enables the central extension of L3 to function like a lever, and as such contribute to allosteric repositioning of rRNA structural elements (13,17). However, it was not clear how a small radial movement of thin, essentially planer element, could have such large and long ranging effects on rRNA structure and ribosome function. The perpendicular orientation of the basic thumb may answer this: we propose that it amplifies the action of this lever by adding three-dimensionality to the central extension in the form of a platform upon which structural elements from three different domains of 25S rRNA are anchored. In support of this, comparison of the L3 structures between EF-Tu and EF-G bound Thermus thermophilus ribosomes (55) reveals displacement of the \u03b1-carbon backbone of the W-finger and basic thumb structures by \u223c2\u20133 \u00c5, and of some individual sidechains by as much as 5 \u00c5 (Supplementary Figure S1). This model explains how the L3 central extension can have significant effects on coordinating the flow of information among the critical functional centers of the LSU, as well as to the SSU.",

The current study focusing on eight amino acids in the L3 basic thumb neutralized their positive charges with alanine substitutions both singly and in selected pairs. The lethality of the R240A mutant as the sole form of L3 indicates that it may function to \u2018glue\u2019 the PTC proximal stem of H90 with the H61-H64 loop, and may well aid in coordinating formation of the C2876-G2922-G2951 A-minor motif that is critical for the \u2018induced fit\u2019 function of the peptidyltransferase center (5,6). Similarly, R247, which bridges Helix 61 with Helix 90 had profound effects on rRNA structure, ribosome biochemistry, translational fidelity, and cell growth, suggesting that it too is a critical bridging component between these two domains. Interestingly, the R247A/R248A double mutant was lethal, while R248A had a wild-type phenotype. This confirms the role of R247 and also indicates that the molecular defect conferred by the R247A single mutant might be partially complemented by the positively charged R248 adjacent to it. R240A and R247A appear to be the exception rather than the rule however, as the other single mutants had significantly lesser effects on these parameters. This is consistent with mutagenesis studies on other residues of L3, and with other LSU proteins and rRNA bases (11\u201315,17,23,56\u201357), suggesting that the ribosome is an elegantly evolved molecular machine containing multiple levels of functional redundancy. Furthermore, all of the double mutants tested had strong effects on binding of aa-tRNA and eEF2, and on peptidyltransfer (Figure 3), suggesting that it multiple defects are generally required to disrupt the functionally redundant interactions between the basic thumb and the LSU rRNA. As an aside, the observation that A2926 (base paired to U2920) was protected from 1M7 modification in wild-type ribosomes when both A- and P-sites were occupied by tRNAs but deprotected when only the P-site was occupied (Figure 4A) is unique to yeast. To our knowledge, this has not been observed in E. coli ribosomes (51), which contains a G-C base pair (C2551-G2557) at this position, a conformational difference that suggests a potentially novel antibiotic target. Interestingly, Haloarcula marismortui appears to split the difference with a G-U base pair (U2576-G2582).",

            "text": "Some specific changes in rRNA structure are particularly telling. The base stack of aa-tRNA C74 with H. marismortui U2590 (E. coli U2555, yeast U2924) is thought to promote the induced fit of peptidyltransfer (6). The enhanced deprotection of this base in R247A mutant ribosomes when both A- and P-sites were occupied by tRNAs is consistent with its strong effect on peptidyltransferase activity by this mutation (Figure 3 H). Interestingly, this base was also strongly deprotected under the same conditions in K237A mutant ribosomes, but in this case peptidyltransferase activity as monitored using the puromycin reaction was actually enhanced (Figure 3H). The rates of peptidyltransfer observed in the current study (\u223c0.3 min\u22121) and in similar analyses using E. coli ribosomes are significantly lower than naturally occurring rates [estimated to be >300 s\u22121, (58)] because Ac-Phe-tRNA is a poor substrate for this reaction. However, this property actually enables us to tease out the effects of local structural changes on PTC activity. Recent molecular dynamics simulations of portions of the ribosome reveal that individual bases can undergo a conservable degree of structural mobility due to local Brownian movements [reviewed in (59)], suggesting that specific bases in the PTC are relatively free to assume either the induced or uninduced conformations in the absence of tRNAs, and that the equilibrium between these two states is influenced by the presence or absence of aa-tRNA in the A-site. Thus, we suggest that R247A mutant drives this equilibrium toward the uninduced conformation, while the K237A mutant favors the induced arrangement. The observation of distinctly different patterns of rRNA protection/deprotection (e.g. compare G2912, C2929, U2953, G2977, C2985, A2995, G3003, A3006, G3009, U3019, U3023 and A3033 between the K237A and R247A mutants in Figure 4A) is consistent with the idea that they also have opposing effects on PTC conformation and functionality. In addition, early studies demonstrated that while empty ribosomes are heterogeneous in their affinity for eEF2, consisting of two sub-populations having Kd\u2019s for eEF2 ranging from subnanomolar to hundreds of nanomoles (60), the affinity for eEF2 strongly depends on the functional status of the ribosome as determined by the occupancy status of the A- and P-sites (61,62). This suggests that the R247A and the double mutants that increased eEF2 affinity shift this equilibrium as well, possibly stabilizing ribosomes in the pre-translocation state, and that the interactions between the 25S rRNA bases and L3 amino acid residues investigated here are involved in transitions between the pre- and post-translocational states.",

The latter is reflected in their different effects on ligand binding to the A-site: R247A promoted very strong effects on both aa-tRNA and eEF2 binding as compared to the much weaker effects conferred by K237A. Examination of the ligand binding data reveals a reciprocal relationship between affinities for aa-tRNA and eEF2, i.e. increased aa-tRNA Kd correlates with decreased eEF2 Kd (Figure 3). This is consistent with the model that L3 plays a central role as an allosteric switch to coordinate binding of elongation factors, opening and closing of the accommodation corridor, and PTC activity to ensure the unidirectionality of protein synthesis (13,17). Interestingly, all of the mutants affected peptidyltransfer, consistent with observations that this process is highly sensitive to even minor structural changes in the ribosome [reviewed in (63)].",

            "text": "In the end, the most important parameter is life; i.e. how does the L3 basic thumb contribute to the fitness of the organism? While only some of the mutants had gross effects on cell growth, they all affected translational fidelity as monitored by decreased rates of \u22121 PRF (Figure 2). In fact, the effects on \u22121 PRF correlated well with the A-site aa-tRNA-binding data. For example, R247A and K241A/R244A, which had the most pronounced effects on \u22121 PRF, also promoted >3-fold decreases in affinity for aa-tRNA. In contrast, R232A and K236A, which had the smallest effects on aa-tRNA binding, also promoted the smallest decreases in \u22121 PRF. As noted above, the mutants investigated in this report are unique in that they are the first examples that promoted decreased \u22121 PRF. This trend had only previously been observed with anisomycin, a competitive inhibitor for aa-tRNA 3\u2032 binding to the PTC (41). We have suggested that the majority of \u22121 PRF occurs after aa-tRNA accommodation into the A-site, and prior to peptidyltransfer, while a smaller fraction can occur during translocation [reviewed in (64)], a view that is supported by a recent study coupling kinetic modeling of \u22121 PRF within the translation elongation cycle with mass spectroscopic analyses of frameshifted peptide products (P.-Y. Liao et al., submitted for publication). By this model, decreased rates of aa-tRNA accommodation into the A-site should decrease the steady state abundance of substrate for \u22121 PRF, thus inhibiting this reaction. Changes in \u22121 PRF in turn alter the relative amounts of viral protein products available for viral particle self assembly, a ratio that is critical for virus propagation (18,40). This illustrates how minute changes in ribosome structure at the atomic scale can propagate outward, affecting ribosome biochemistry, translational fidelity, and the ability of cells to replicate viruses.",
