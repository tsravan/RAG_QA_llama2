Influenza A and C viruses can infect multiple mammalian species, while influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen (7). Influenza A viruses cause the greatest morbidity and mortality in humans. Interestingly, the largest pool of influenza A viruses is maintained by horizontal spread in wild aquatic birds, in which the virus does not normally cause any disease (6,8). Food and companion animal populations such as poultry, swine, horses and dogs support sustained replication of certain lineages of influenza A, with minimal to lethal disease depending on the virulence of the strain (6). Influenza viruses have evolved in association with their various hosts in different continents for extended periods of time (9). This co-evolution has resulted in extensive genetic divergence among the extant viruses currently available for analysis.",

So far, 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes have been found (10). In recent years, gene sequences have become available for a large number of viral strains creating a diverse pool of influenza A viruses from historical and current isolates collected in multiple geographic regions. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the HA and NA revealed an excellent agreement between the results of clustering viruses by the antigenic reactivity and sequence similarity. However, molecular genetic analysis allows a comprehensive analysis of the entire viral genome and is gaining popularity because it is more practical for most laboratories as a method for classification (11). Most importantly, study of the influenza genomic structure, namely genotyping, could reveal mechanisms of virus evolution, spread and disease pathogenesis.",

The viral genome evolves through accumulation of mutation by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which lacks proofreading ability and through reassortment of entire gene segments(13). Forces selecting viral variants such as the neutralizing antibody response of vertebrate hosts as well as species-related structural variation can also promote rapid evolution (14). Each of the segments can evolve at a different rate if they are subject to differential selective pressures and functional constraints (15\u201319). The segmented nature of the viral genome allows for segment exchange (termed reassortment) when two distinct viruses co-infect a cell and generate progeny with a mixed genome (20,21). Reassortment may theoretically yield 254 (28 \u2013 2) different combinations of gene segments from two parent viruses.",

A nomenclature for influenza A viral genotypes will allow researchers to unequivocally describe influenza A viral genotypes to analyze, compare and communicate the molecular epidemiology of the virus.

Likewise, there are nine alleles for NA, and two alleles for non-structural (NS) proteins. Since influenza A viruses have an unusual genomic structure, we approached the genotyping problem by first analyzing each gene segment separately. According to the above conventions and considering that the evolutionary rate varies from segment to segment, we defined a genotype as a sequential combination of the lineages for each of the eight segments in a genome. A letter was assigned to each lineage of PB2, PB1, PA, NP and M, and a number followed by a letter was assigned to each lineage of HA, NA and NS with the number representing the subtype or allele. For example, [A,D,B,3A,A,2A,B,1A] is the genotype of a human seasonal subtype H3N2 virus with PB2 lineage A, PB1 lineage D, PA lineage B, HA subtype 3, lineage A and so on, following the convention for numbering of influenza genome segments. With this nomenclature, identifying genotypes and reassortment becomes an easy task accomplished by comparing the predicted genotype against all genomes that have been classified previously.",

The MEGA software was used to construct the phylogenetic trees with the neighbor-joining method and the HKY-85 model selected (23). The goal of our genotype method is to determine when a reassortment event with a gene segment from a non-traditional host or location has occurred. The lineages of each viral gene were carefully determined as detailed subsequently: (i) using the phylogenetic trees constructed, significant clusters (which were segregated by \u223c10% nucleotide difference by p-distance) were assigned lineages; (ii) bootstrap analysis was used on a smaller set of sequences with values >90% considered significant; (iii) the initial lineages were evaluated for nucleotide differences within and between other lineages and for strength of bootstrap support; (iv) approximately 10 sequences from each lineage were randomly selected for the maximum likelihood (ML) analysis for each gene segment, serotype (for HA, NA) or allele (for NS) on the MultiPhyl server (24).

For example, in 1998, a serotype H3N2 virus was isolated from swine in North America, A/swine/Nebraska/209/1998 (26). Using FluGenome, this H3N2 virus had the genotype [C,D,E,3A,A,2A,A,1A] (Figure 3). It has been reported that this new genotype (termed \u2018triple reassortant\u2019) arose from reassortment events between human H3N2 viruses, swine H1N1 viruses and North American avian viruses of unknown serotype (27). The potential parent human H3N2 been circulating in humans since 1968 and has a genotype of [A,D,B,3A,A,2A,B,1A]. The triple reassortant virus acquired its HA, NA and PB1 gene segments from this seasonal human H3N2. The PB2 and PA genes arose from reassortment with avian viruses found in North America (with PB2 internal gene similar to A/mallard/ALB/126/1991 (CY005317) and PA gene similar to A/blue-winged teal/Alberta/141/1992 (CY004543)). The remaining three gene segments (NP, MP, NS) come from the classical H1N1 swine viruses whose genotype is [B,A,C,1A,A,1B,A,1A]. Although the NP and NS lineages are shared between the classical swine and human influenza viruses, the BLAST results show the closest matching isolates are swine in origin. Since 1998, this triple reassortant virus itself has undergone further reassortment with other swine and human influenza A viruses (28\u201331).\n",
