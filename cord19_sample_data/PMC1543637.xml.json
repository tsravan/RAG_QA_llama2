It is characterized by rapid onset of fever and sore throat, accompanied by vesicles and ulcers on the gums, tongue, buccal mucosa and palate. Punctate and usually transient skin lesions appear on the palms, soles and occasionally on the buttocks, knees or other areas. While the fever and rash may subside rapidly, the mouth lesions may last more than a week, and virus may continue to be shed for several weeks [1]. In temperate countries HFMD occurs during the summer but in the tropics HFMD can occur at any time during the year.",

Other enteroviruses isolated from HFMD cases are the other species A human enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus A (CVA) 4, CVA5, CVA6 and CVA7, and coxsackievirus B (CVB) 1, CVB2, CVB3 and CVB5 [2-4]. Unlike other aetiological agents of HFMD that normally cause mild disease, HEV71 infection has been reported to cause neurological disease manifesting as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis[5]. First isolated from a child suffering from encephalitis in California in 1969, HEV71 was further isolated from 23 cases with severe neurological disease in California during the next three years[3]. Historically, HEV71-associated outbreaks have been reported in Australia in 1972[6], Japan in 1973 and 1978[7], Bulgaria in 1975[8] and Hungary in 1978[9].",

This programme was set up as part of the operational functions of the Sarawak Health Department and was approved by the Director of Health. The principles of the Helsinki Declaration were followed throughout the surveillance operation.",

All sentinel clinic doctors obtained parental consent before swabs were taken. Sentinel clinic doctors were provided with feedback on viruses isolated from their patients and contact was maintained through both outbreak and inter-outbreak periods to assure doctors that the surveillance programme was active and ongoing. Data obtained in this manner were expected to provide accurate information about disease trends and molecular epidemiology of the relevant viruses.",

All children presenting to the sentinel clinics with a history of oral or other skin lesions typical of HFMD were enrolled into the surveillance study, and throat and rectal swabs were obtained from each child enrolled in the first 18 months. Where possible, swabs were also obtained from mouth ulcers, vesicles and other skin lesions. After a preliminary analysis of data from the first 18 months, the protocol was modified to require only throat swabs from sentinel clinics. Rectal swabs were optional and doctors were requested to provide vesicle swabs whenever possible. Specimens were to be transported on ice to the laboratory in 2 ml of viral transport medium (VTM) where they were vortexed, freeze-thawed and aliquoted.",

Dr. Mark Pallansch (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta) generously made the primer sequences available to us prior to publication[19]. All PCR products were sequenced to confirm the identification. In 2002, we changed our protocol for identification of HEV71 due to problems of misidentification of local strains of CVA16 as HEV71 using the primer set 159S/162A[20]. Currently, HEV71 specific primers designed in-house are used for specific identification of HEV71[20]. All primers used are listed in Table 1.",

When Ishiko's method[23] was published in 2002, we made a comparison of the methods by serotyping new isolates using both methods. We determined that for human species A enteroviruses circulating in our region, Ishiko's primers gave identical serotype identification to that obtained using Oberste's method[21]. Since there was no discrepancy between the methods, we modified Ishiko's primers to convert the method from a semi-nested to a non-nested method for ease of use. Our modifications were verified and described by Cardosa and colleagues[24]. We then retrospectively retested all non-HEV71 enteroviruses isolated prior to 2002 using the modified method.",

To our surprise we observed a shift in genogroup from C to B in the early phase of the outbreak. The first cases of HEV71 associated HFMD presenting to our sentinel clinics were determined to have HEV71 of genogroup C1. The number of HFMD cases being admitted to hospitals also began to rise in early February and continued to rise through the next month (data not shown). We found that the number of HEV71 isolates recovered from both patients admitted to hospitals and patients presenting to our sentinel clinics during this period followed this trend. HEV71 of genogroup B5 was isolated in small numbers in the first 6 weeks of the outbreak (epidemiological week 5 to 10) and as the numbers of genogroup C1 viruses isolated began to decline, the numbers of genogroup B5 viruses isolated began to rise, showing a dominance of genogroup B5 viruses from epidemiological week 11 onwards. To illustrate this, we have taken a snapshot of data available at epidemiological week 20 [see additional file 1] to show the virological situation at that point in time. Thus, in 2003 there were in fact 2 clusters of HEV71 cases emerging. The main outbreak was associated with HEV71 genogroup B5, but this was preceeded by a smaller cluster of cases infected with HEV71 genogroup C1.",

By week 7 a clear rise in the number of cases was seen. This early rise in cases differs from the summer outbreaks seen in temperate countries, and we suggest that the HEV71 outbreaks in Sarawak preceed the summer outbreaks of countries in the northern hemisphere in each year. In 2000 the HFMD outbreak stretched to the end of the year, peaking between weeks 11 to 13. The 2003 outbreak was cleaner, rising around the same time as the 2000 outbreak, but peaked at week 12 and declined sharply to very few cases by week 19. However, the epidemiological curves of HEV71 cases were similar in both 2000 and 2003. The number of HEV71 cases in 2000 dropped sharply by the end of June (by week 27) being replaced largely by CVA16 until the end of the year (see Figure 1). In 2003, the number of HEV71 cases declined sharply by the end of April (by week 18) and were no longer detected by the end of June, coinciding with the last HFMD cases seen that year. Interestingly this outbreak coincided with the SARS outbreak in the region and the public health measures put into place during this time evidently served to control the transmission of enteroviruses as well.",

More than 2000 specimens from outbreak and non-outbreak periods were tested from 1998 to 2005. Enteroviruses were grown from 21.6% of those tested. Throat swabs comprised 72.3% of the total number of specimens tested and 25.4% of these yielded enteroviruses. Detailed information about the enterovirus serotypes isolated during this surveillance programme is also provided [see additional file 2]. Although on the whole, the virus isolation success rate was much lower than anticipated from the results for the first 18 months, it remained the case that throat swabs were more useful than the rectal swabs which yielded non-polio enteroviruses in only 5.8% of the samples tested. It should be noted however, that the first 18 months of the study coincided with an inter HEV71 epidemic period, with mostly CVA16 and non-HEV71 species A human enteroviruses causing HFMD. We have compared the virus isolation yields during HEV71 outbreak (2000 and 2003) years with the yields during an HFMD outbreak caused by non-HEV71 enteroviruses (2002) and we found that we successfully isolated virus from 40% of specimens collected in 2002 but only 20% of viruses during the HEV71 outbreak years, suggesting that HEV71 is more difficult to isolate than CVA16 and other species A enteroviruses. The virus isolation rate in the first 18 months (44%) is therefore comparable to that obtained later, when HEV71 was not circulating.",

Although the surveillance programme is still ongoing in Sarawak, we have sought to glean some preliminary information from the data generated over the first 7 years of the programme. During this time there have been 2 outbreaks of HEV71 in Sarawak with smaller clusters of HFMD associated with CVA16 and other species A human enteroviruses occurring concomitantly with as well as independently of the two HEV71 outbreaks. A recent report on a similar surveillance programme in Yamagata Prefecture in Japan (1998\u20132003) suggests that in Yamagata there is frequent importation of HEV71 from surrounding countries seeding the clusters of cases seen annually in this community[10]. The HEV71 strains in this study were isolated from small clusters of cases that tended to be seen in the summer months while in our situation we observed outbreaks of HEV71 every 3 years with cases being seen much earlier in the year, well before the northern summer. In 2003 both Sarawak and Yamagata experienced a large outbreak and in both situations, a genogroup shift from C to B was noted.",

Since the outbreaks in Sarawak typically begin early in the year, it is also possible that genogroup B strains generated in Sarawak may seed HEV71 outbreaks in the region, which typically occur later than the Sarawak outbreaks. This temporal sequence of regional outbreaks is also true of those occurring in Singapore and in Peninsula Malaysia.",

This was especially evident in 2000, when HEV71 associated fatal cases were reported in neighbouring Singapore in September and October 2000[29], and the media attention surrounding these events generated a high index of suspicion in Sarawak as well. No HEV71 was isolated in Sarawak after August that year, but numerous CVA16 continued to be isolated until the end of 2000. Thus even though sociological factors affect the shape of the HFMD epidemiological curves in Sarawak, epidemiological curves specifically showing genogroup B strains of HEV71 were consistently sharp and well defined in 2000 and 2003.",

It is thus intriguing that HEV71 has caused much larger and sharper outbreaks than either CVA16 or CVA10. This suggests that HEV71 has the capacity to spread rapidly through the susceptible population and then become quiescent in the community. In the third year after any HEV71 outbreak, the whole cohort of children under 3 years of age has not been exposed to HEV71 and all of these children are then susceptible, providing the conditions for another sweeping transmission of HEV71 through the community. The annual birth cohort in Sarawak is 48 to 49 thousand and thus in 3 years there are up to 150,000 susceptible children in the state.",
