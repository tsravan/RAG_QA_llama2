            "text": "Hepatitis G virus was reported first time has a non-A-E hepatitis and placed as flavivirus [1].The induction of this new agent in the family of Hepatitis has attracted significant attention because of its etiology [2]. Hepatitis G virus has been marked as a cause of non-A through E acute viral hepatitis and sharp liver failure. Aplastic anemia complicating hepatitis is an uncommon but well recognized phenomenon. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia is a severe disorder with a high mortality (85%) [3].Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a deviation of aplastic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an acute attack of hepatitis. The marrow failure can be severe and is usually lethal if untreated. Lorenz and Quazier has documented first time HAAA in two case back in 1955 [4], by 1975 more than 193 cases had been reported [5]. Adil et al has reported, severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) 51.4%, very severe (VSAA) in 16.7% of 144 patients of aplastic anemia cases [6]. A number of reports have mentioned alliance between HGV and HAAA [7-10]. Number of HAAA cases with a history of multiple blood transfusions has been reported [11,12]. Crespo et al has documented a case of 24 year old man have community acquired HGV that later progress into severe aplastic anemia, point out HGV for both hepatitis and aplastic anaemia. However greater number of serum samples are needed to prove the association of hepatitis G virus and aplastic anaemia [13]. Moatter et al. has reported 5/43 patients of haemodialysis with raised liver enzyme, reduced platelet count and 21/100 patients of polytransfused b- thalassemia major children infected with HGV RNA form Pakistan [14,15].",

The diagnosis of HA-aplastic anemia was made on the basis of hepatitis (elevated serum aminotransferase enzymes, jaundice, absolute neutrophils counts, platelet counts and reticulocytes. All the 93 samples were checked for serological marker of HAV, HBV,HCV, HDV, HEV, HGV,TTV and B19. One of 93 samples from patients with HA-aplastic anemia has hepatitis G associated aplastic anaemia with positive HGV RNA.",

The laboratory investigation parameters were: haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte count 0.5%, Monocytes 0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine aminotransferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative, whereas HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G virus.

Byrnes et al has described hepatit G Virus positive case of 26 year old man before the use of medication, blood tranfusion or intravenous drug abuse [9]. Zaidi et al, reported a 19 year male before blood transfusion with positive HGV by RT-PCR and suggested that in the absence of any other clincial manifestions the possible infectious agent may be HGV for hepatitis G virus associated aplast anaemia [8].
