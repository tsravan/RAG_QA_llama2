However, to have the greatest impact, pandemic vaccines need to be available quickly and in large quantities, and to be delivered to the population optimally. Moreover, vaccines against a novel pandemic strain might take up to six months to manufacture and deliver, even in developed countries [5]. Given the potential threat of drug-resistance resulting from widespread use of antiviral treatment against pandemic flu, vaccine appears to be our primary weapon to prevent and to mitigate a pandemic. However, in addition to the need to consider the logistics of implementing large-scale vaccination, distinctly different age-specific mortalities had also been observed during some past flu pandemics (e.g., in 1918 [6]), which require different priorities when large-scale vaccination is to be implemented.",

Setting priority for vaccination by targeting age groups most vulnerable (the elderly, infants, etc.) to prevent mortalities is commonly employed in most countries. However, when vaccinating those at greatest risk of mortality becomes impractical (if, e.g., medical care is relatively inaccessible) or inefficient (if, e.g., immune response is deficient), targeting those most likely to expose them to infection might be more preferable [10]. In this way, the very young and the old might be better protected by vaccinating those who are most likely to be in contact with them (thereby reducing their risk of exposure), rather than by being vaccinated. Comparison of influenza mortality among elderly Japanese during time periods when schoolchildren were and were not vaccinated suggests that the infected children pose a risk to others [11], including the elderly. Moreover, several past US experiences (as summarized in [12]) also are consistent with this conclusion. Nonetheless, influenza policymakers have typically advocated protecting those individuals of ages 6-24 months and >65 years directly.",

[13] recently carried out a comparative analysis of two classes of suggested vaccination strategies, namely, the mortality-based strategies that target the high-risk populations and the morbidity-based strategies that target the high-prevalence populations, by applying the methods of contact network epidemiology to a model of disease transmission in a large urban population. Using a range of mortality rates reported previously for past influenza epidemics and pandemics, they concluded that the optimal strategy depends critically on the viral transmission level (or reproduction number) of the virus. That is, the morbidity-based strategies outperform the mortality-based strategies for moderately transmissible strains, while the reverse is true for highly transmissible strains. However, they also cautioned that when information pertaining to viral transmission rate of a particular disease and the frequency of new introductions into the community prior to an outbreak is unreliable or not available, a mortality-based vaccination priority is recommended. This further demonstrates the importance of targeting and, moreover, the uncertainty surrounding this issue.",

In this current study, we will consider a traditional compartmental model which incorporates both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, in order to explore the role which they could play in the overall spread of disease, if any. Moreover, the age-group structure of the model, by dividing the population into seven groups of the very young, preschool children, younger and older schoolchildren, young adults, adults, and the elderly, allows us to study targeted public health policies (e.g., immunization) aimed at different age groups. Our model also allows for inclusion of immunity and other age-dependent intervention measures such as quarantine and voluntary home withdrawal (see e.g., [15,16]). A full model will be proposed to take into account of the above-mentioned factors that may be important in determining the best vaccine strategy.",

To avoid adding an extra compartment to account for the (short) period of infectivity after the end of the latent period and before the end of incubation period (see e.g., [20]), we assume that the individuals are infective during the incubation period with the infectivity averaged out over the whole incubation period.

The aim of this vaccine program is hopefully to lower the seasonal influenza incidence across all age groups of the population. In anticipation of future investigation on public health impact of this program, we carry out model simulations by dividing the Taiwan population into 7 age groups (see Table 2), and by making use of the weekly Taiwan influenza vaccination data for young children of age 2 or less (age group 1, with free flu vaccination since 2004) and the elderly of 65 or older (age group 7, with free flu vaccination since 2001) during the 2004-2005 winter flu season.

We note that day 105 was January 22, 2005, when all schools in Taiwan closed for the winter vacation which lasted until after the traditional lunar New Year holiday, in mid-February of that year. The school closure, and subsequent shutdown of all non-essential venues during the week-long New Year holiday, surely had a significant impact on the contact rates which was not reflected in our constant contact matrix that implicitly assumes that inter-age group contact patterns remain the same during the whole season. More precisely, the P&I deaths for the elderly exhibits a slight increase for about 3 weeks after the closing of schools (shortly after the New Year) when compared to the model predicted values, while the P&I deaths for the adults of age 22-64 dropped substantially below the theoretical curve. These results indicate that the school closure and the subsequent New Year holiday led to more frequent contacts by the elderly in the households with family members who spent more time at home during the holidays At the same time, there were less contacts for the adults at the workplace (especially for those working in the educational facilities who had longer holidays) during this time period. Since most individuals in the elder group (and the very young) are not directly affected by the school closings and the holidays, one may speculate that the difference in the actual mortality and the theoretical mortality of the elderly, as averaged over the whole time period, is due at least in parts to the impact of interaction between the elderly and younger children with the school-age children and adults, when the activity levels (in terms of frequency as well as whom to make contact with) of the latter groups were significantly changed by the holidays.",

Although a recent study to quantify the effect of school closures during the 2008 winter influenza season in Hong Kong did not find the school closures as having a substantial effect on the community transmission [30], our results indicate the need for further studies on this topic. We also note that, normally, one would like to use averaged excess winter season P&I mortality data over other seasons for the data fitting of seasonal influenza. However, Taiwan often experiences summer influenza epidemics which would offset any attempt to obtain a reasonable \"excess\" P&I mortality for the winter season.",

One explanation for this apparent lack of impact of vaccination during the 2004-2005 flu season, as indicated by the value of RV, is that the vaccination data we used is only for groups 1 (age 0-2) and 7 (age >64). In the formula for RV, or more precisely for  in Equation (7), cij2 is the daily contact frequency between groups i and j. The contact frequencies of groups 1 and 7 [Additional file 1: Table A2] are substantially smaller than the contact frequencies of the other groups, with the exception of within-group contacts and contact between groups 1 and 2 (age 3-5) in daycare facilities. Therefore, the relative impact of targeting these two groups for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving further evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating the very young and the very old on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. However, simulation with the same parameter values as in Fig. 3 except assuming no vaccination in the young children and elderly age groups, i.e., \u03c51(t) = \u03c57(t) = 0, and everything else the same produces Fig. 5, where the result indicates that the impact of no vaccination (red curves) would still be significant, resulting in nearly 4-fold increase in mortality of elderly and 2-fold increase in mortality of adults. Therefore, the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence sometimes might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with intervention but could still be substantial, since it is a simple mathematical property that distinctly different (next generation) matrices may have similar eigenvalues.",

This further highlights the high vulnerability of the elderly (or the younger children) to exposure from other age groups, and demonstrates the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent the elderly (or younger children) influenza mortality. On the other hand, the estimated per contact transmission probabilities for the younger (<3) and the elderly (>64) infectors are also both higher than those of the other groups (see the last row in Table 2), but not significantly so except when compared with those between ages 8-14. The higher transmission probabilities of young children and elderly infectives could reflect, again, the fact that contacts with these individuals are usually of a more intimate nature, although these probabilities are not as drastically different as their vulnerability to be infected. The less likelihood of schoolchildren of 8-14 to infect others might also be attributable to signs of their less intimate contacts with others as they grow into adolescence.",

However, since RV = (-1)n+1 det RV + 1, where  is the matrix with  its ijth element, the effective reproduction number with vaccination only, RV, does not necessarily decrease as the effective vaccination rate \u03bdi\u03c0i increases. In other words, vaccination is not always beneficial in reducing incidence and the design of an effective vaccination program in multi-group model is highly nontrivial, unlike in simple epidemic models where there is a simple formula for the critical vaccination coverage level necessary for eradication (pc) [20]. In fact, it has been shown mathematically by Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez [32], using a model with a core group, that partially effective vaccination program may actually increase the total number of cases. Explicit quantification of an optimal vaccination policy ([33]) in a multi-group population scenario remains to be a challenge for mathematical modelers and is beyond the scope of this work. Moreover, the model fit was carried out with vaccination (of the elderly and small children of age 2 or less) as the only intervention since vaccination was the only intervention that was implemented during the flu seasonal for which the fitted P&I data was collected. Further simulations with quarantine and home withdrawal also can be easily carried out.",
