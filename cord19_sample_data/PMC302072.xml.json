            "text": "hnRNP A1 is an RNA-binding protein that contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a glycine-rich domain responsible for protein\u2013protein interaction. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and transport of cellular RNAs (reviewed by Dreyfuss et al., 1993). It is predominantly located in the nucleus, but also shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Pi\u00f1ol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992). The signal that mediates shuttling has been identified as a 38 amino acid sequence, termed M9, located near the C-terminus of hnRNP A1 between amino acids 268 and 305 (Michael et al., 1995; Siomi and Dreyfuss, 1995; Weighardt et al., 1995). Yeast two-hybrid screening with M9 as bait resulted in the discovery of a novel transportin-mediated pathway for nuclear import of hnRNP A1 (Pollard et al., 1996; Fridell et al., 1997; Siomi et al., 1997). The function of the cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 has not been well defined. Studies have shown that cytoplasmic and nuclear hnRNP A1 exhibit different RNA-binding profiles. Cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 is capable of high-affinity binding to AU-rich elements that modulate mRNA turnover and translation (Hamilton et al., 1993, 1997; Henics et al., 1994). It has also been shown to promote ribosome binding to mRNAs by a cap-mediated mechanism, and prevent spurious initiation at aberrant translation start sites (Svitkin et al., 1996).",

            "text": "MHV belongs to the Coronaviridae family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. MHV replication and transcription occur exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (reviewed by Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). Initially, the 5\u2032-most gene 1 of the viral genome is translated into the viral RdRp, which then replicates the viral genomic RNAs into negative-strand RNAs. Subsequently, the negative-strand RNAs are used as templates to transcribe mRNAs, which include a genomic-sized RNA and a nested set of subgenomic mRNA transcripts, all with an identical 5\u2032 non-translated leader sequence of 72\u201377 nucleotides and 3\u2032 co-terminal polyadenylated ends. The subgenomic mRNA transcription of MHV utilizes a unique discontinuous mechanism in which the leader sequence, often derived from a different molecule, is fused to RNAs at the intergenic (IG) sites (i.e. transcription initiation site) to generate subgenomic mRNAs (Jeong and Makino, 1994; Liao and Lai, 1994; Zhang et al., 1994). The exact mechanism of how these mRNAs are made is still controversial. However, it has been shown that the process of discontinuous RNA transcription is regulated by several viral RNA elements, including the cis- and trans-acting leader RNA (Liao and Lai, 1994; Zhang et al., 1994), IG sequence (Makino et al., 1991) and 3\u2032-end untranslated sequence (Lin et al., 1996). There is considerable biochemical evidence suggesting possible direct or indirect interactions between the various RNA regulatory elements. hnRNP A1 binds MHV negative (\u2013)-strand leader and IG sequences (Furuya and Lai, 1993; Li et al., 1997). Site-directed mutagenesis of the IG sequences demonstrated that the extent of binding of hnRNP A1 to the IG sequences correlated with the efficiency of transcription from the IG site (Zhang and Lai, 1995; Li et al., 1997). Immunostaining of hnRNP A1 showed that hnRNP A1 relocated to the cytoplasm of MHV-infected cells, where viral RNA synthesis occurs (Li et al., 1997). hnRNP A1 also mediates the formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex containing the MHV (\u2013)-strand leader and IG sequences (Zhang et al., 1999). These results suggest that hnRNP A1 may serve as a protein mediator for distant RNA regions to interact with each other.",

In addition to MHV, hnRNP A1 has also been reported to interact with human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene 2 protein, which plays an important role in the regulation of virus replication (Wang et al., 1997). Furthermore, a yeast protein related to human core RNA splicing factors, Lsm1p, has been shown to be required for the efficient replication of brome mosaic virus RNA (Diez et al., 2000). Recently, Reddy and colleagues demonstrated an inhibition of HIV replication by dominant-negative mutants of Sam68 (Reddy et al., 1999). However, none of these cellular proteins has been shown experimentally to participate directly in RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.",

We showed that the mutant hnRNP A1, which was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, exhibited dominant-negative effects on viral genomic RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription. In contrast, overexpression of the wt hnRNP A1 accelerated the synthesis of all viral RNAs. Our results provide strong evidence that hnRNP A1 is directly or indirectly involved in MHV RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm and that the C-terminal part of the protein is important for its function. This finding thus reveals a novel function for hnRNP A1 in the cytoplasm.",

This mutant lacks part of the glycine-rich domain and the M9 sequence responsible for shuttling hnRNP A1 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Immunoblot of the whole-cell lysates with an anti-Flag antibody detected a 34 kDa protein in DBT-A1 cells and a 27 kDa protein in three independent clones of DBT-A1\u0394C cells (Figure 1B), whereas no protein was cross-reactive to the anti-Flag antibody in the control cell line stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector (DBT-VEC). The amounts of the Flag-tagged wt and truncated hnRNP A1 were comparable in these cell lines. A chicken polyclonal antibody against hnRNP A1 detected two endogenous hnRNP A1 isoforms or hnRNP A1-related proteins in the whole-cell lysates of all of the cell lines. The bottom band (34 kDa) overlaps the Flag-tagged wt hnRNP A1 in DBT-A1 cells. There was only a slight increase in the overall amount of hnRNP A1 in DBT-A1 cells as compared with DBT-VEC cells, indicating that the exogenous hnRNP A1 constituted a small fraction of the total hnRNP A1 in the cells. In DBT-A1\u0394C cells, an additional band of smaller size (27 kDa) corresponding to the mutant hnRNP A1 was detected. The overall expression levels of the exogenous hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A1\u0394C were \u223c3-fold lower than that of the endogenous hnRNP A1 in whole-cell lysates (Figure 1B). Similar to the endogenous hnRNP A1 protein (Pi\u00f1ol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992), the Flag-tagged wt hnRNP A1 was localized almost exclusively in the nucleus (Figure 1C). The mutant hnRNP A1, however, was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (Figure 1C), consistent with the previous finding that the M9 nuclear localization signal is necessary to localize hnRNP A1 to the nucleus (Siomi and Dreyfuss, 1995; Weighardt et al., 1995). Thus, hnRNP A1\u0394C was much more abundant than the endogenous hnRNP A1 in the cytoplasm. The expression levels of the wt or mutant hnRNP A1 varied among individual cells based on immunofluorescent staining (Figure 1C). The growth rate (Figure 1D) and cell morphology (data not shown) were similar among the different cell lines.",

Virus infection was performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.5 to detect the subtle morphological differences among the different cell lines. Syncytia appeared at \u223c7 h post-infection (p.i.) in DBT-VEC cells and \u223c1 h earlier in DBT-A1 cells. At both 8 and 14 h p.i., syncytia were significantly larger and more spread out in DBT-A1 cells than those in DBT-VEC cells (Figure 2A). Similar differences were observed with two additional clones of DBT-A1 cells (data not shown). In contrast, no syncytium was observed in three different clones of DBT-A1\u0394C cells, even at 14 h p.i. At 24 h p.i., almost all DBT-A1 cells detached from the plate, but \u223c10\u201320% of DBT-VEC cells still remained on the plate (data not shown). Remarkably, there was no sign of syncytium formation in DBT-A1\u0394C cells until 24 h after virus infection, when the overall morphology of the cells was similar to that of DBT-VEC cells at 7 h p.i. (data not shown). All of the DBT-A1\u0394C cells were eventually killed at \u223c48 h p.i., suggesting that the inhibition of viral replication was not a result of the disruption of the MHV receptor. Correspondingly, virus production from these cell lines was significantly different. Between 6 and 14 h p.i., virus production from DBT-A1\u0394C cells was \u223c100- to 1000-fold less than that from DBT-VEC and DBT-A1 cells (Figure 2B). DBT-A1 cells produced twice as many viruses as those from DBT-VEC cells during that time period.",

In order for hnRNP A1 to participate directly in viral transcription, it has to be recruited to the site of RNA synthesis. Although hnRNP A1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in normal cells (Pi\u00f1ol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992), the level of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 is very low. We have demonstrated previously that hnRNP A1 relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of MHV-infected cells (Li et al., 1997). To determine whether the overexpressed hnRNP A1 may participate in MHV RNA synthesis, we performed immunostaining experiments using an anti-Flag antibody to localize Flag-tagged hnRNP A1. In DBT-A1 cells, a significant increase in the cytoplasmic level of hnRNP A1 and a corresponding decrease of nuclear hnRNP A1 were observed in virus-infected cell syncytia at 7 h p.i. (Figure 3B); these cells express the MHV nucleocapsid (N) protein in the cytoplasm (Figure 3A). By comparison, in the uninfected cells, which did not have N protein staining, hnRNP A1 was predominantly localized to the nucleus (arrow in Figure 3B). In DBT-A1\u0394C cells, very few cells were stained positive for the MHV N protein at 7 h p.i. (Figure 3C). Significantly, the viral N protein was detected only in the cells that were stained weakly or not at all for Flag-hnRNP A1 (Figure 3D), suggesting that the expression of a high level of hnRNP A1\u0394C interfered with viral replication.",

Similar patterns of differences were observed for the N protein in these three cell lines. Actin levels in different cell lines remained relatively constant throughout the infection, except that, in DBT-A1 cells, actin was not detected at 16 and 24 h p.i. due to the loss of the dead cells (Figure 4A). These results clearly demonstrated that overexpression of the wt hnRNP A1 accelerated viral protein production, whereas expression of the mutant hnRNP A1 delayed it. We also performed immunofluorescent staining of the N protein at 7 h p.i. to further confirm the western blot results. As represented by images shown in Figure 4B, there were more DBT-A1 cells stained positive for the N protein than DBT-VEC cells. Very few cells were found to express the N protein in DBT-A1\u0394C cells. The p22 and N proteins appeared as doublets in some of the lanes of Figure 4A, but the results varied from experiment to experiment. The N protein is known to be phosphorylated (Stohlman and Lai, 1979). Whether p22 is post-translationally modified is not known.",

[3H]uridine incorporation in DBT-VEC cells increased gradually from 4 h p.i. and peaked at \u223c16 h p.i. (Figure 5A). DBT-A1 cells showed a significantly higher level of [3H]uridine incorporation, which peaked at \u223c8 h p.i. DBT-A1\u0394C cells did not show any detectable level of incorporation of the radioactivity. These results suggest that hnRNP A1 regulates MHV RNA synthesis. We further assessed the production of genomic and subgenomic MHV RNAs in these cell lines by northern blot analysis. The genomic and the six subgenomic RNA species were detected at 8 h p.i. in both DBT-VEC and DBT-A1 cells; there were significantly higher steady-state levels of all of the RNA species in DBT-A1 cells (Figure 5B). In contrast, no viral RNA was detected in DBT-A1\u0394C cells at that time point. At 16 h p.i., MHV RNA levels in DBT-VEC and DBT-A1 cells decreased generally because of the loss of the dead cells, while the smaller subgenomic RNAs became detectable in DBT-A1\u0394C cells. By 24 h p.i., most viral RNA species became detectable in DBT-A1\u0394C cells (Figure 5B, lane 10), while most of the DBT-A1 cells were dead (lane 9). These results confirmed that the synthesis of all of the viral RNA species is accelerated by overexpression of the wt hnRNP A1 and delayed by a dominant-negative mutant of hnRNP A1.",

CAT activity can be expressed from this DI RNA only if a subgenomic mRNA containing CAT sequences is produced (Liao and Lai, 1994). The 25CAT RNA was transfected into MHV-A59-infected cells 1 h after infection. At 8 h p.i., CAT activity in DBT-A1 cells was significantly higher than that in DBT-VEC cells (Figure 6A). On the other hand, CAT activity was very low in DBT-A1\u0394C cells. At 24 h p.i., CAT activity in DBT-A1 cells became slightly lower than that in DBT-VEC cells because of the loss of the dead DBT-A1 cells. The CAT activity in DBT-A1\u0394C was still significantly lower than that in DBT-VEC or DBT-A1 cells. These results established that mRNA transcription from the DI RNA was also inhibited by hnRNP A1\u0394C.",

To confirm this result, we further studied replication of another DI RNA during serial virus passages. DBT cells were infected with MHV-A59 and transfected with DIssE RNA derived from JHM virus (Makino and Lai, 1989); the virus released (P0) was passaged twice in DBT cells to generate P1 and P2 viruses. DBT cells were infected with these viruses, and cytoplasmic RNA was extracted for northern blot analysis using glyoxalated RNA for a better resolution of smaller RNAs. For DBT-A1\u0394C cells, RNA was extracted at 36 h p.i. since viral RNA synthesis was delayed in this cell line. Cells infected with P0 viruses did not yield detectable amounts of DIssE, but contained the naturally occurring A59 DI RNA, whose replication was inhibited more strongly than the synthesis of MHV genomic and subgenomic RNAs in DBT-A1\u0394C cells (Figures 5B, lanes 8\u201310 and 6B, lanes 1\u20133). However, this A59 DI RNA was not detectable in cells infected with P1 and P2 viruses (Figure 6B, lanes 4\u20139). In contrast, DIssE appeared in cells infected with P1 viruses and further increased in cells infected with P2 viruses, indicating that the replication of the smaller DIssE may have an inhibitory effect on the replication of the larger A59 DI RNA (Jeong and Makino, 1992). Similar to the A59 DI RNA, the replication of DIssE RNA was much more strongly inhibited than that of MHV genomic and subgenomic RNAs in DBT-A1\u0394C cells (Figure 6B, lanes 6 and 9). Our results thus suggest that MHV DI RNA replication is more dependent on the function of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1.",

GST pull-down assay using various truncation mutants of hnRNP A1 showed that the N protein bound the N-terminal domain (aa 1\u2013163) of hnRNP A1 (Figure 7B); thus, the binding of hnRNP A1\u0394C [equivalent to hnRNP A1(1\u2013245)] to the N protein was not affected. We next examined the in vivo interaction of the wt and mutant hnRNP A1 with an MHV ORF 1a product, p22, which has been shown to co-localize with the de novo synthesized viral RNA (S.T.Shi and M.M.C.Lai, unpublished results) and associate with the viral replicase complex (Gibson Bost et al., 2000). Cyto plasmic extracts from MHV-A59-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody-conjugated beads, followed by western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p22. At 8 h p.i., p22 was co-precipitated with the Flag-tagged hnRNP A1 from DBT-A1 cells, whereas no precipitation of p22 was observed in DBT-VEC cells (Figure 7C). For DBT- A1\u0394C cells, co-immunoprecipitation was performed at 24 h p.i., when abundant MHV proteins were synthesized. p22 was shown to co-precipitate with hnRNP A1\u0394C, indicating that hnRNP A1\u0394C still formed a complex with the viral polymerase gene product.

In addition, hnRNP A1 is also implicated in viral RNA replication by the recent finding that hnRNP A1 interacts with the 3\u2032-ends of both positive- and negative-strand MHV RNA (P.Huang and M.M.C.Lai, unpublished results). However, the functional importance of hnRNP A1 in viral RNA synthesis has so far not been directly demonstrated. In the present study, we established that MHV RNA transcription and replication were enhanced by overexpression of the wt hnRNP A1 protein, but inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative hnRNP A1 mutant in DBT cell lines. Our results suggest that hnRNP A1 is a host protein involved in the formation of a cytoplasmic transcription/replication complex for viral RNA synthesis.

The overexpressed exogenous wt hnRNP A1 in DBT-A1 cells was predominantly localized in the nucleus, similar to the endogenous hnRNP A1 (Figure 1C). The C-terminal-deletion mutant, however, was localized mainly in the cytoplasm. Thus, the level of hnRNP A1\u0394C was much higher than the endogenous wt hnRNP A1 in the cytoplasm of DBT-A1\u0394C cells, where MHV replication occurs.

Furthermore, hnRNP A1\u0394C caused not only a global inhibition of genomic RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription, but also a preferential inhibition of at least two DI RNA species. These results suggest that the inhibition of MHV replication by the hnRNP A1 mutant was most likely a direct effect on viral RNA synthesis rather than an indirect effect on other aspects of cellular or viral functions. Since hnRNP A1 binds directly to the cis-acting MHV RNA sequences critical for MHV RNA transcription (Li et al., 1997) and replication (P.Huang and M.M.C.Lai, unpublished results), it is most likely that hnRNP A1 may participate in the formation of the transcription/replication complex. Indeed, our data show that hnRNP A1 interacts directly or indirectly with the N protein and a gene 1 product, p22, both of which are probably associated with the viral transcription/replication complex (Compton et al., 1987; Wang and Zhang, 1999; Gibson Bost et al., 2000). hnRNP A1 may participate directly in viral RNA synthesis in a similar role to that of transcription factors in DNA-dependent RNA synthesis, e.g. by maintaining favorable RNA conformation for RNA synthesis. Alternatively, hnRNP A1 may modulate MHV RNA transcription or replication by participating in the processing, transport and controlling the stability of viral RNAs. It has been reported that RNA processing of retroviruses, human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (Black et al., 1995) and HIV-1 (Black et al., 1996), is altered by the binding of hnRNP A1 to the viral RNA regulatory elements. It is also possible that hnRNP A1 may participate in MHV RNA synthesis indirectly by affecting the production of other host cell proteins, which may, in turn, regulate MHV RNA synthesis. Since hnRNP A1 is a dose-dependent alternative splicing factor (Caceres et al., 1994), even small changes in the intracellular level of hnRNP A1 can alter the splicing of other cellular proteins. Regardless of the mechanism, our study established the importance of cellular factors in viral RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.",

In addition, the replication of the naturally occurring A59 DI RNA and the artificial DIssE RNA was completely abolished (Figure 6B). Surprisingly, the replication of MHV DI RNAs suffered a stronger inhibition by the dominant-negative mutant of hnRNP A1 than the synthesis of MHV genomic and subgenomic RNAs, suggesting that DI RNA replication may be more dependent on hnRNP A1. Although DI RNAs contain all of the cis-acting replication signals that are essential for their replication in normal cells (Kim and Makino, 1995), the small size of DI RNA may cause it to require more hnRNP A1 to maintain a critical RNA structure. It has been shown that different DI RNAs require different cis-acting signals for RNA replication (Kim and Makino, 1995).",

It is possible that hnRNP A1\u0394C is not productive due to its inability to interact with other viral or cellular proteins that are involved in MHV RNA synthesis. We have found a protein of \u223c250 kDa that binds only the wt, but not the mutant hnRNP A1 (Figure 7D). It remains to be shown whether this cellular protein is involved in MHV RNA synthesis.",

Since hnRNP A1 protein is involved in a variety of important cellular functions, including RNA splicing, transport, turnover and translation, it is conceivable that other redundant gene products may substitute for the function of hnRNP A1 in CB3 cells. Indeed, UV-crosslinking assays using CB3 cell extracts detected two proteins comparable to hnRNP A1 in size that could interact with the MHV negative-strand leader RNA (data not shown). These proteins may represent hnRNP A1-related proteins, since many of such hnRNPs exist in the cells (Buvoli et al., 1988; Burd et al., 1989). Therefore, multiple cellular proteins may have the capacity to be involved in MHV RNA synthesis.",

We hypothesize that hnRNP A1 is one of the components of the MHV RNA transcription or replication complex, and the crosstalk between hnRNP A1 and another viral or cellular RNA-binding protein (designated X in Figure 8) is essential for MHV replication and transcription. The X protein binds to the C-terminus of hnRNP A1 and cooperates with hnRNP A1 to recruit more proteins to form the transcription or replication complex. The C-terminal-deletion mutant of hnRNP A1 loses the ability to interact with the X protein and to bring it into the initiation complex, resulting in an inhibition of MHV RNA transcription and replication. The residual replication and transcription activities of MHV RNA in the absence of functional hnRNP A1 may be due to a limited affinity of the X protein to a cis-acting signal that is only present in MHV genomic RNA (site B). On the other hand, DI RNAs may lack this cis-acting signal. When the crosstalk between the X protein and hnRNP A1 is abolished by the dominant-negative mutant of hnRNP A1, the X protein can no longer participate in the formation of the initiation complex, resulting in a complete loss of DI RNA replication.",

Increasing amounts of purified GST (0, 0.5, 1.5 and 5 ng) or recombinant GST\u2013hnRNP A1 fusion protein (0, 1, 3 and 10 ng) were included in the reaction to compete with the endogenous hnRNP A1 for binding. The reaction mixture was placed on ice and UV-irradiated in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) for 10 min, followed by digestion with 400 \u00b5g/ml RNase A for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. The protein\u2013RNA complexes were then separated on a 10% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography.",
