However, there are usually many time scales that are well separated (due\ntypically to a large range in order of magnitude of the parameters) when considering such\nhigh-dimensional problems. In the presence of well-separated time scales, a model reduction\nmethod is needed to examine the dynamics on a lower-dimensional space.

Because the noise\naffects the timing of outbreaks, it is essential to produce a low-dimensional system that\ncaptures the correct timing of the outbreaks as well as the amplitude and phase of any\nrecurrent behavior.",
