Because the responses of the lungs to injury change with time, the evolution of the injury and repair should also be reproduced in the model, even if specific studies focus on a narrow time frame. In humans, the intrapulmonary inflammatory response begins before the onset of clinically defined ALI and is most intense in the first 3 days after the onset of ALI/ARDS (78, 158). The acute inflammatory phase is followed by a chronic fibroproliferative phase in patients who remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. In patients who survive, pulmonary function tests often show restriction, consistent with the parenchymal fibrosis seen in lung biopsies or autopsy specimens (137, 173).",

            "text": "The acute physiological changes at the onset of ALI/ARDS in humans include severe hypoxemia that is usually responsive to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a fall in total thoracic compliance caused by reduced lung compliance. A marked increase in extravascular lung water is caused by an increase in endothelial and epithelial permeability, associated with an impairment in the ability of the alveolar epithelium to actively clear alveolar fluid (37, 134, 193, 234). These changes cause severe ventilation/perfusion mismatching and an increase in shunt fraction. Studies that have sampled lung alveolar fluids either by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or by direct aspiration of edema fluid using deep airway suction have shown that the hallmark is an acute neutrophilic inflammatory response with fibrin-rich proteinaceous exudates containing an array of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 165). ALI/ARDS also occurs in neutropenic patients, when alveolar structures are damaged by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents (156). Markers of the fibrotic response such as procollagen peptide III are evident as soon as the lung injury begins (29, 130) and are greatest in patients who die (29, 130). Surfactant abnormalities were suspected when ALI/ARDS was first described, and abnormalities of surfactant composition and function have been described in a number of studies (80, 81, 164).",

These studies confirm the severe epithelial and endothelial injury and the late fibroproliferative response (Fig. 1). The injury to the epithelium tends to be more pronounced than the endothelial injury (10), but endothelial injury and microvascular thrombi are detectable, supporting angiographic findings in humans with ALI/ARDS (218). The hallmark of the late fibroproliferative response is injury of the alveolar basement membrane, with fibroblast proliferation and increases in types I and III collagen in the alveolar walls and the alveolar spaces (173).",

Ideally, the injury should evolve over time if the animals are supported for prolonged periods. One of the most difficult aspects of modeling human ALI in humans is that the lungs of humans can be affected by the mechanisms involved in the primary illness (e.g., sepsis) and/or they can be affected by therapeutic modalities used for supportive care (e.g., mechanical ventilation) (224). This increases the complexity of the ideal animal model of lung injury, as it requires the incorporation of specific treatment modalities into experimental protocols, adding additional variables to the experimental design.",

Because humans and mice diverged as separate species millions of years ago, they have adapted to pathogens that are specific to their unique environmental niches, so it is not surprising that differences exist in the innate immune response of humans and mice to microbes and microbial products. Leukocytes and some mesenchymal cells of humans and lower animals recognize microbial products via a group of specialized pattern recognition receptors called Toll-like receptors. The work of Hajjar and colleagues (83) suggested evolutionary divergence in these receptors by showing that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) from humans and mice recognize different lipopolysaccharide structures. Other examples include species differences in TLR2 (133, 146), TRL3 (89), TLR7, TLR8 (248), and TLR9 (100) (reviewed in Ref. 175). Species differences in innate immune responses need to be taken into account in selecting animal models of ALI for specific experimental protocols.",

Most evidence suggests that PIM are not part of the MPS in normal humans (236). The role of PIMs in the development of lung injury was investigated in studies through depletion of these macrophages in sheep, which decreased endotoxin-induced lung injury (206). Therefore, the presence of PIM increases the susceptibility of a species to lung injury (Table 2), which should be taken into account when developing animal models of human lung injury (236).",

For example, the production of NO during the TLR-mediated antimicrobial response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis varies among species. In humans, macrophages kill M. tuberculosis through a vitamin D-dependent response (127). In contrast, mice, nocturnal animals with minimal exposure to sunlight, have developed a TLR-mediated pathway in macrophages, which kills M. tuberculosis through NO-dependent mechanisms (216). Additional studies show that human and rodent macrophages differ significantly in their ability to produce NO. Rodent macrophages produce large amounts of NO, whereas normal nonactivated human macrophages make very little NO (187, 188). Macrophages of cattle produce NO, whereas macrophages of hamsters, monkeys, goats, and pigs are more like human macrophages and generate very little NO (48, 104, 106, 188). Variability in the production of NO by macrophages of different species must be taken into consideration when extrapolating results from animal studies to humans (Table 2).",

CXCL8 and related CXC-chemokines are produced by all species in response to bacterial products. Mice and rats lack the gene for CXCL8 but produce two related CXC chemokines, KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). KC and MIP-2 share more sequence identity with human CXCL1-3/GRO\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 than they do with CXCL8 (253) but are considered the functional homologs of human CXCL8 because of their critical role in the recruitment of neutrophils into lungs (219). Recent work by Fan and colleagues (58) demonstrated that mice express two CXC-receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, similar to humans, and that human CXCL8 and mouse GCP-2/CXCL6 bind murine CXCR1. In contrast, murine MIP-2 and KC activate neutrophils by binding to murine CXCR2 and do not bind to murine CXCR1. Additional work is needed to determine the role of murine GCP-2/CXCL6 in the development of ALI in mice.",

This is especially true when physiological parameters such as arterial oxygen tension and mean arterial pressure are monitored (135). Until recently, body size has prohibited the measurement of physiological parameters in mice. With the development of small implantable radiotelemetry transmitters, the measurement of systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature is now possible in unrestrained mice, although it remains difficult and expensive (27). Size is also an important consideration for the collection of blood. It is easier to obtain sufficient quantities of blood or to obtain multiple blood samples in larger species such as the rabbit or nonhuman primates. The ability to obtain multiple blood samples is important when the study design requires monitoring of physiological parameters, such as blood gases, plasma cytokines, and leukocyte counts over time. Conversely, cost constraints, the amount of reagent required, and availability can limit the use of larger species.",

A number of excellent reviews of the production of genetically modified mice are available (56, 97, 203) (reviewed in Refs. 22, 41, 91, 252). An important consideration when using genetically modified mice is the selection of appropriate controls to eliminate genetic and environmental background effects (200). The best controls are congenic mice, which are essentially isogenic with an inbred strain of mice except for the gene of interest. Another option is to use the offspring of heterozygous breeding pairs, so that age- and sex-matched littermates can be used to minimize environmental and genetic variability. From a practical standpoint it is often difficult to use congenic mice or the offspring of heterozygous breeding pairs because of the number of animals involved. However, it is important to understand how to select appropriate controls for experiments using transgenic mice so that robust conclusions can be drawn about the function of specific genes.",

Within 1 min of intravenous oleic acid administration (0.04 ml/kg in dogs), electron microscopy reveals severe vacuolation of endothelial cells, and passage of an intravascular marker, Evans blue dye, into the subendothelial space (144). The damage to the endothelium appears to be due to necrosis, rather than apoptosis (96). Endothelial injury is followed by epithelial injury, with swelling and necrosis of type I cells, but no evidence of apoptosis (96). Within 30 min, oleic acid becomes detectable in the air spaces. Oleic acid is not detected intracellularly and remains in the extracellular space and the air spaces (17). The actual mechanism whereby oleic acid induces cell death is not clear, but direct membrane damage is likely to be an important event.",

Regardless of the route of intravenous administration (peripheral vs. central), the effects of oleic acid are evident almost immediately (247).

Microscopically, the injury is multifocal and heterogeneous, with some areas showing only minimal changes; other areas show interstitial edema and varying degrees of air space edema, and some areas show extensive hemorrhagic infiltration with fibrin deposition (74, 221) (Fig. 2). There is neutrophilic infiltration, but the injury is not dependent on PMN, suggesting that a direct effect of oleic acid on the endothelium is the critical event (105). Electron microscopic examination reveals necrosis and detachment of alveolar epithelial cells, necrosis of endothelial cells, and exposure of the basement membrane on both the epithelial and the endothelial sides (221). On macroscopic examination, the lungs show patchy areas of hemorrhage and edema, which become confluent in dependent areas. Nondependent areas are usually spared (44, 46).",

Pulmonary microvascular permeability is markedly increased, with elevation of extravascular lung water and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the interstitium and the air spaces (46, 247). These changes in alveolar permeability are proportional to the dose of oleic acid, develop within 1 h of administration, and are rapidly reversible, with the alveolar fluid clearance normalizing within 8 h (54). There are also severe alterations in gas exchange, with respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and increased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference within 90 min of intravenous administration (40, 46, 170, 221). The gas exchange alterations result from severe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching, increased intrapulmonary shunt, and increased dead space ventilation (170). The static lung compliance and functional residual capacity (FRC) fall rapidly, and mean airway pressure rises (40, 125). Systemically, the cellular damage induced by oleic acid becomes evident rapidly, and increases in circulating angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) can be detected within 2.5 min after intravenous administration of 0.1 ml/kg to dogs (151). The hemodynamic responses are dose dependent and are characterized by myocardial depression, early systemic hypotension, and pulmonary hypertension (40, 46, 125, 190, 231).",

A major advantage of this model is its reproducibility; the administration of the same dose of oleic acid by the same route to different animals is followed by a reasonably reproducible pulmonary injury. Oleic acid instillation provides an excellent model to study ventilatory strategies, lung mechanics, and V/Q distribution during lung injury in large and small animals. One disadvantage is the requirement for intravenous administration, which requires expertise in small animals like mice. One question is the extent to which this type of injury actually occurs in humans, because few cases of ARDS are associated with long bone trauma or lipid injury (95), and there is no evidence that the pathophysiology of the injury caused by oleic acid (direct toxicity to endothelial cells) is similar to that underlying ARDS associated with sepsis and aspiration. Therefore, the oleic acid model is probably not as appropriate for studying the pathophysiology of ALI due to sepsis, or therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying host inflammatory responses to reduce the severity of lung injury.",

In serum, LPS binds to a specific LPS binding protein (LBP) (131, 217), forming an LPS:LBP complex that activates the CD14/TLR4 receptor structure on monocytes, macrophages, and other cells, triggering the production of inflammatory mediators (211, 244, 249) (Fig. 3, C and D).

Animals with PIM develop manifestations of sepsis and lung injury with very small doses of LPS, e.g., in the \u03bcg/kg range. In contrast, animals without PIM require much higher doses, in the range of mg/kg. In addition to species susceptibility, there are also differences in LPS responses between different strains of the same species. For example, BALB/c mice are very sensitive to LPS, whereas C57BL/6 mice are more resistant.",

Thus, the use of LPS provides information about the effects of host inflammatory responses, which occur in bacterial infections. LPS has some significant disadvantages, however. LPS preparations vary in purity and can be contaminated with bacterial lipoproteins and other bacterial materials (211). In general, LPS treatment does not cause the severe endothelial and epithelial injury that occurs in humans with ARDS (239). Bacteria produce exotoxins that are potent cellular toxins (122) and use effector systems such as the type III systems that cause direct cellular lysis (183). Thus, LPS by itself provides an incomplete picture of the effects of live bacteria in the lungs.",

One of the main characteristics of gastric contents is a low pH, so investigators have used hydrochloric acid (HCl) to simulate lung injury due to gastric acid aspiration in animals. However, it is important to keep in mind that in addition to low pH, gastric contents contain several other products such as food particles, bacterial cell wall products, and cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, and also have a very high osmolarity. All of these factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of aspiration-induced lung injury (118, 172). An important consideration is that a very low pH is required to produce lung injury in animals, e.g., pH 1.5, lower than is typically measured in human gastric contents, but the low pH model remains widely used.",

However, acid aspiration also results in injury to the capillary endothelium, by a mechanism that appears to require circulating neutrophils (60, 117).

Although HCl is rapidly neutralized in the lungs, the concentration of HCl affects the severity of injury. Most studies use 0.1 N HCl, although higher concentrations (up to 0.5 N) have been used. Because this results in a pH that is generally lower than that of gastric juice [most ICU patients have gastric juice pH in the range of 3.0\u20134.0 (23)], an alternative method is to use 0.3% NaCl titrated with HCl to a pH of 1.2\u20131.5.

The acute inflammatory response is followed by a fibrotic response that is evident \u223c1 wk after instillation (250). The main physiological features are an immediate increase in airway resistance and peak pressures, a fall in lung compliance, and a decrease in the FRC. The vascular response includes elevation of the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, with an increase in the shunt fraction and dead space. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and heart rate remain unchanged, whereas the cardiac output and mean arterial pressure either decrease or remain unchanged (159). The main systemic consequences are leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Interestingly, the endobronchial administration of 0.1 N HCl is followed by an increase in microvascular permeability in the ileum, which can be blocked with antibodies targeting neutrophil adhesion molecules (anti-CD18) (207), showing that acid aspiration in the lungs is linked to neutrophil-dependent injury to distant organs.",

Acid aspiration can also be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as mechanical ventilation, to further reproduce clinically relevant scenarios (60). A limitation of the acid aspiration method is that the difference between injurious and noninjurious acid concentrations is very narrow. Another limitation is that humans do not aspirate HCl, but instead aspirate complex gastric contents, which is a suspension of particulate matter, bacterial products, cytokines, and a pH that is usually higher than 1.5. Further studies are needed to determine whether these differences between gastric fluid and HCl result in a difference between this model and the injury seen in humans following the aspiration of gastric contents.",

Many clinicians suspect that oxygen may exacerbate and even cause ALI in critically ill patients, although there still is no conclusive evidence that oxygen either produces or exacerbates ARDS in humans (42).

During normal cellular respiration in the mitochondria, a small fraction of oxygen undergoes the addition of a single electron to form the superoxide anion (O2\u2022\u2212). Superoxide anions can be protonated to perhydroxy radicals (HO2\u00b7) or can react further to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, in the presence of divalent metals, can react together to form hydroxyl radicals (OH\u00b7), which are extremely reactive. Normally, the small amounts of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide produced during cellular respiration are scavenged by antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (69). In the presence of hyperoxia, the mitochondria and other organelles produce increased amounts of superoxide anions (68), which may exceed the capacity of antioxidant enzymes and consume cellular glutathione. Furthermore, superoxide anions react with NO to form peroxynitrite, a potent oxidizing molecule. There is evidence that peroxynitrite is formed in the lungs of hyperoxic humans (202) and animals and that induction of NO synthesis worsens hyperoxic lung injury (90).",

The lung epithelial cell line A549 becomes apoptotic in vitro when exposed to oxidants such as H2O2 (65). However, preexposure to oxygen inhibits the apoptotic response to H2O2, and this is mediated by activation of NF-\u03baB (65). In mice exposed to hyperoxia, neither the number of apoptotic cells nor the severity of injury is attenuated by caspase inhibitors, and Fas-null (lpr) mice and p53 knockout mice are not protected from hyperoxic lung injury (11). However, disruption of the proapoptotic CD40-CD40 ligand system and overexpression of IL-6 each reduce the number of apoptotic cells and prevent hyperoxic lung injury (2, 233).",

The initial event appears to be damage to the capillary endothelium, followed by platelet adhesion and PMN accumulation in the capillary vessels and interstitium (13, 82). Eventually, alveolar epithelial injury occurs, with an increase in microvascular permeability measured as wet-to-dry (W/D) ratios and migration of neutrophils into the air spaces, as evidenced by increase in total numbers in BAL fluid (18, 20, 102, 148). The pulmonary architecture is preserved during this early phase (82). The initial exudative phase is followed by a proliferative phase, characterized by proliferation of endothelial cells and type 2 pneumocytes, which cover the denuded alveolar basement membrane. Fibroblast proliferation occurs while the endothelial damage persists. Recovery from oxygen injury is characterized by a normal-appearing endothelium and epithelium, with only some areas of interstitial scarring (109). Interestingly, there is synergism between hyperoxia and infection, and the presence of bacterial pneumonia increases the morphological and physiological changes associated with hyperoxia (33).",

Rats exposed to 85% O2 for 5\u20137 days can survive subsequent exposures to 100% O2 (13).

Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins that has several important functions (88). Surfactant decreases surface tension and prevents collapse of the alveolar spaces at low lung volumes. Surfactant proteins stabilize surfactant and modulate host defenses in the lungs (243). Depletion of surfactant may be associated with lung injury by two mechanisms: first, by facilitating alveolar collapse and increasing the likelihood of mechanical injury to the alveolar walls during repeated cycles of opening/closure during mechanical ventilation, and second, by impairing alveolar host defenses. The administration of bovine surfactant and/or synthetic surfactant-related peptides attenuates the injury produced by saline lavage (35, 229).",

These findings are rapidly reversible by recruitment maneuvers such as sustained inflation, suggesting that the gas exchange abnormalities reflect collapsed alveoli with otherwise intact alveolar walls (99, 182). The saline lavage by itself has little consequence in terms of permeability changes or inflammation (71, 182), although TNF-\u03b1 is detectable in lavage fluid (98). When saline lavage is followed by mechanical ventilation with high volumes and no PEEP, a type of lung injury results that is very similar to ARDS in humans. The lung injury is dependent on PMN and is characterized by increased protein permeability, PMN infiltration into the air spaces and interstitium, increased cytokine production, and hyaline membrane formation (99, 110, 124). Mechanical ventilation alone, without previous saline lavage, can induce similar findings (53, 145, 220). Instilling LPS into the air spaces intensifies the injury response to surfactant depletion (34). Rabbits subjected to lung lavage with 0.9% NaCl, five aliquots of 30 ml/kg each, followed immediately by instillation of 0.25 \u03bcg/kg LPS, and then mechanical ventilation with 100% FiO2, develop minimal inflammation at 4 h but progress to significant neutrophilic alveolitis and protein-rich alveolar edema at later times (34).",

In ALI/ARDS, surfactant abnormalities occur because of injury of the alveolar epithelium and exudation of protein-rich edema fluid into the alveolar spaces. Saline lavage of the lungs results in surfactant depletion in the absence of major alveolar epithelial damage. Epithelial damage occurs only when the saline lavage is followed by an injurious ventilatory strategy. Therefore, surfactant depletion followed by mechanical ventilation simulates established ALI/ARDS and provides information about the consequences of surfactant depletion, but it is less useful in modeling the initial pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to ALI/ARDS.",

Overstretching of alveolar walls results in endothelial and epithelial breaks and interstitial edema (70). Detachment of endothelial cells from the basement membrane and death of epithelial cell with denuding of the epithelial basement membrane become obvious after 20 min of mechanical ventilation with very high tidal volumes (produced by peak pressures of 45 cmH2O in rats) (51). However, the development of hyaline membranes and increased permeability require the presence of PMN, suggesting that in addition to mechanical damage, inflammatory damage is also necessary for mechanical ventilation to induce injury (110). Mechanical cell deformation can be converted to biochemical changes, including production of proinflammatory cytokines (168, 225) and changes in lipid trafficking (226). The inflammatory component of VILI remains controversial, as studies by Tremblay et al. (218a) showed increased production of inflammatory cytokines in lungs ventilated without PEEP, by a mechanism different from that of LPS (19), whereas studies by Ricard et al. (178) have reported no association between VILI and production of proinflammatory cytokines in the same animal model.",

However, patients requiring chronic ventilation for neuromuscular disease and normal lungs are routinely ventilated with large tidal volumes, e.g., 10 ml/kg or larger, yet they do not develop ALI. Recent studies have demonstrated that the combination of noninjurious mechanical ventilatory strategies with small doses of LPS or bacteria that cause minimal inflammation results in the development of a form of lung injury characterized by cytokine release, neutrophilic alveolitis, and protein leakage into the air spaces, showing that mechanical ventilation and bacterial products are synergistic in causing lung injury (4, 47, 154).

Endotracheal intubation avoids inflammatory responses associated with tracheostomy and can be achieved with practice. The animals must be anesthetized throughout the ventilation protocol, and this may make it difficult to determine whether the mice are alive or dead unless other variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, or end-dial CO2 are monitored. Airway pressures should be monitored, as lung compliance can change as injury develops. Body temperature must be monitored and maintained within a narrow range because mice are extremely sensitive to temperature changes. PEEP can be generated with a PEEP valve attached to the end of the ventilator. Fluids can be delivered intraperitoneally either by injection or using an infusion pump. With adequate monitoring and support, mice can be ventilated for 8 h or longer (47).",

The bleomycin model has been reviewed in more detail elsewhere in this series (143). Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus (222). Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death (26). Bleomycin can be inactivated by bleomycin hydrolase, a cysteine protease that shows variable levels of expression in the lungs (194). The susceptibility of the lungs to bleomycin-induced toxicity is largely dependent on the levels of expression of bleomycin hydrolase in the lungs; species with high levels of expression, such as rabbits, are relatively resistant to bleomycin-induced toxicity, whereas species with low levels of expression, such as C57BL/6 mice, are sensitive (126). In addition to species-related differences in bleomycin susceptibility, there are also differences in strain susceptibility, with C57BL/6 mice being highly sensitive and Balb/c and C3H mice being resistant; however, the differences in strain susceptibility to bleomycin appear to be related more to differential expression of genes involved in apoptosis regulation or oxidative stress than to differences in the expression of bleomycin reductase (87).",

The intravenous model mimics the human clinical scenario but requires the administration of the drug twice per week for 4\u20138 wk (1). In contrast, the intratracheal model requires the administration of one single dose of bleomycin (143). It is important to emphasize that although both models result in lung injury and fibrosis, the site of initial injury is different: the endothelium is the primary target of intravenous bleomycin, and the epithelium is the primary target of intratracheal bleomycin. The dose response and pathological changes of the lung to intravenous bleomycin were first described in 1974, and we refer readers to the original Adamson and Bowden report (1). Here we will focus on the intratracheal model, which is the most widely used due to its lower complexity and high reproducibility.",

Within 24 h of bleomycin administration, there is an increase in BAL neutrophils, which then normalize towards day 11. The lymphocytic response follows, beginning around day 7 and persisting on day 11. The fibrotic response becomes detectable in tissues by day 11 and persists by day 20. As for cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, KC, IL-6, TNF, and IL-1R1 peak between 6 and 63 h, TGF-\u03b2 R1 and R2 peak towards day 7, and G-CF, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-4 peak towards day 14 (28, 76, 180, 246). At the tissue level, the early phase is characterized by patchy neutrophilic alveolitis and the late phase by patchy areas of fibrosis, but there is no formation of hyaline membranes (Fig. 3, G and H). The extent of fibrosis is proportional to the severity of the initial injury (197). Thus, the bleomycin model is relatively technically easy, very reproducible, well standardized, and reproduces the pattern of ALI, with early inflammation that heals with fibrosis. The main disadvantage is that the physiological relevance of bleomycin is often questioned, with the argument that intratracheal instillation of bleomycin is an \u201coverwhelming stimulus\u201d that bears little relevance to the clinical setting. Despite these caveats, the bleomycin model remains one of the most commonly used models of ALI in mice.",

A classic form of injury secondary to lung I/R is the \u201creimplantation response,\u201d a form of lung injury following lung transplantation. The reimplantation response is characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, inflammatory infiltrates, and hypoxia, and is unrelated to rejection (167, 199). Lung injury is also associated with ischemia/reperfusion at distant, nonpulmonary sites. For example, a 20\u201340% incidence of ALI has been reported following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, which involves visceral ischemia and reperfusion (237). This type of injury affects the alveolar epithelium and the capillary endothelium. It is unclear whether the epithelium and the endothelium are both injured simultaneously or whether the injury occurs primarily in endothelial or epithelial cells. Studies in humans and rabbits show that both types of cells have features compatible with apoptosis and necrosis (59, 186, 208).",

The lungs are perfused by two separate vascular systems, the pulmonary circulation and the bronchial circulation. Ischemia can be produced by clamping the pulmonary artery, which preserves the bronchial circulation, or by clamping the hilum, which stops all circulation. In a variant of the lung I/R model, ischemia is achieved by lung collapse, followed by reexpansion (101). Electron microscopic examination of cat lungs treated with 2 h of ischemia (inflated lungs) and 2 h of reperfusion shows structural damage of the alveolar endothelium and epithelium, with separation of type II cells from the basement membrane, thickened vascular endothelium, and disruption of the septal capillary wall (149). An interesting feature of this model is that I/R of one lung results in inflammatory changes not only in the occluded lung but also in the contralateral lung (185). The injury to the contralateral side, when present, is milder and characterized by permeability changes and PMN infiltration (84, 157).",

When the ischemic time is kept constant and the reperfusion time is varied (30 min to 2 h), the severity of injury increases with longer reperfusion times (113, 149).

These methods require that the animal be anesthetized. In abdominal I/R, the abdominal cavity is left open during the ischemic period and covered by a plastic wrap.

Three main strategies have been used to induce sepsis: 1) the administration of live bacteria, 2) the creation of an endogenous infection, e.g., cecal ligation and puncture, and 3) the administration of bacterial products, such as endotoxin. The following sections address models that use live bacteria, because LPS models have been discussed in Endotoxin. Important variables in live bacteria models of ALI include: the route of administration, the size of the bacterial inoculum, the bacterial species, and the animal species. In general, more severe responses are seen in species with PIM than in those without PIM.",

The administration of an intravenous bolus of bacteria is followed within an hour by an initial phase of hypotension and leukopenia, which can progress to septic shock, intravascular coagulation, and death if the inoculum is high. If the animals survive, the initial phase is followed between 1 and 3 h later by a brief period of hemodynamic stabilization and then by a phase of microvascular injury with PMN sequestration in the lungs, an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability, interstitial edema, an increase in shunt fraction and pulmonary arterial pressure, and intravascular thrombosis (238). However, the alveolar epithelium is relatively resistant to intravenous bacteria, and unless the inoculum is very high, there is little neutrophilic alveolitis or intra-alveolar edema formation (166, 239). Thus, experimental bacteremia is not associated with the full histopathological picture of ARDS, including epithelial damage and hyaline membrane formation. In humans, the relationship between bacteremia, sepsis, and ARDS is not clear. Although sepsis is a major risk factor for ARDS, less than 50% of patients with clinically defined sepsis syndrome have detectable bacteremia, and when present, the bacteremia is usually less severe than that seen in most animal models (142). Furthermore, bacteremia alone (in the absence of sepsis syndrome) is associated with an extremely low risk of ARDS (62). Thus, the relevance of bacteremia models for human lung injury is unclear. Investigators have tried to address these concerns by inducing primary infections that lead to sepsis and lung injury.",

At low bacterial doses, the systemic changes were minimal. At high bacterial doses, the animals developed severe localized pneumonia with epithelial injury and empyema and severe systemic manifestations including shock (64, 240). Interestingly, bacterial pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and also to E. coli is associated with an increase in alveolar fluid clearance, indicating that alveolar epithelial function is partly preserved (177, 210). Histologically, the intratracheal administration of bacteria results in localized pneumonia (rather than ARDS) in the instilled lung. However, unilateral administration of bacteria can result in lung injury in the contralateral lung, depending on the bacterial dose. In rats, the administration of 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/ml P. aeruginosa to the right lung results 4 h later in an ipsilateral increase in inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and CINC) but not in neutrophil sequestration or permeability changes (214).

However, human ALI/ARDS is seldom caused by any single event. More often, ARDS in humans is associated with complex interactions between primary risk factors such as sepsis and oropharyngeal aspiration; comorbidities, such as diabetes, alcoholism, and underlying lung disease; and additional factors inherent to the host, such as genetic determinants. Another shortcoming of animal models is that interspecies variability in innate immunity and other responses may affect the relevance of animal data for humans. Finally, most models target a primary tissue, the alveolar epithelium, the alveolar endothelium, or both, but the primary target tissue in human ALI/ARDS remains unknown. These shortcomings, alone or in combination, are probably responsible for the fact that animal models have often yielded different or even contradictory results and that therapeutic approaches effective in animals are not always successful in humans. However, despite these limitations, studies using animal models of ALI/ARDS remain essential because at the present time there is no substitute for animal models as tools to generate information about the pathophysiology of lung injury and to test novel therapeutic interventions in complex biological systems.",

Of the models discussed in this review, the models that most consistently approach the features of human ARDS, at least those observed during the acute phase, include oleic acid instillation, acid aspiration, and hyperoxia. Unfortunately, only a fraction of cases of ARDS is caused by long bone trauma (modeled by oleic acid instillation), humans seldom aspirate gastric juice with pH 1.5 or less, and hyperoxia has not been shown to cause ALI/ARDS in humans (42). Surfactant depletion by saline lavage results in a decrease in lung compliance and hypoxemia, but not in alveolar epithelial injury or neutrophilic alveolitis unless a second injury, such as bacterial endotoxin or mechanical ventilation, is added. Sepsis is one of the most common causes of ARDS in humans, but attempts at modeling sepsis by treating animals with bacteria or bacterial products systemically is usually associated with only mild alveolar neutrophilia and minimal changes in alveolar-capillary permeability.",
