GenBank alone holds over 80,000 close to complete viral genomes, and numbers are rising fast. For example, since the submission of the first SARS genome in May 2003, over 140 more have been published. With this genomic data at hand we hope to finally be able to tackle our understanding of viruses. Mechanisms of selection, that is to say the rate f at which a mutation resulting in a change in amino acid is accepted, and evolution on viruses are still strongly debated, and a methodology which is trimmed towards answering these questions is required. A step towards this is our attempt to develop a method which can deal with the vast amount of viral data, as well as the complexity of viral genomes and their high divergence and subsequent unreliability of alignment.",

These are a feature common to viruses, where due to the three periodicity of the genetic code, up to three genes may be encoded simultaneously. The constraints placed on a nucleotide involved in such a multiple coding region will naturally have an effect on its mutational pattern, and as a result the concept of selection is complicated further. Another complication is the uncertainty of alignments when dealing with genomes of reasonable evolutionary distance. Recent papers have shown that parameter estimation can be greatly biased by the use of a fixed alignment [10].",

In the case of coding for multiple genes, however, a synonymous substitution in one gene may well be non-synonymous in the other and thus constrained. This biases the analysis towards an under-estimation of the 'true' synonymous substitution rate and thus can lead to the false inference of positive selection.",

[1] used this model of varying selection to comparatively annotate two viral genomes with evolved gene structure. McCauley et al.

We may therefore attempt to draw conclusions about the nature of not only selection but also the interaction of selection on two different genes. Also, to study the imprint of evolution on viral genomes, it is necessary for the samples to have a reasonably high level of divergence. A benchmark herefore in our experience would be an evolutionary distance a + 2b of at least 0.4. Since more divergent genomes are harder to align, this brings uncertainty about the alignment into the inference. We decide to circumvent this problem by considering the set of all possible alignments \u2013 and their corresponding likelihood under our model \u2013 , as opposed to a fixed 'optimal' alignment. This method has previously been used for similar purposes, to minimize variability in parameter estimation due to uncertain alignments [10,12].",

Letting the length of the double coding region in our above simulation vary from 600 down to 25, with transition and transversion rate 0.4 and 0.2 respectively, we obtain Figure 2. As to be expected, the shorter the region, the worse our prediction results, since our data set decreases. However, above a length of 50 nucleotides we start picking up selection within a distance of \u00b1 0.15, and above 200 nucleotides we are within the \u00b1 0.1 mark.

The respective overlapping sections in the other reading frames are under selection of 0.31 and 0.64. Similarly with the latter section of the following vif gene, we can see a dramatic increase in positive selection acting on the overlapping region, which rises to 1.50 against a selection of 0.23 in the other reading frame.

Clearly within the HIV2 genome there is much less data than with Hepatitis B, so it is harder to assign a true significance to these figures.

We naturally can not compete with knowing the true alignment, something which sufficient and extremely time consuming manual work can get close to. We do however offer a fast, automatic and efficient alternative to the use of a fixed alignment, which provides a quick and easy way for producing selection factors for different regions in a viral genome. We outperform alignments given by ClustalW consistently. We even beat GenAl for sequences of evolutionary distance below 0.8 and only do slightly worse for ones further apart. It is however additionally worth noting that the sequences we have and generally will be dealing with, will generally have an evolutionary distance of 0.4 \u2013 0.9. We are therefore encouraged to see that our method is competetive compared to the slightly more refined GenAl and hope that this is amplified once also extended to include protein alignment.

Our method manages to circumvent this problem by using a statistical approach, and thus we account for the uncertainty inherent in the alignment by considering all, rather than picking a single \"best\" alignment.

Another point is our fixing a partition prior to analysis. It would be even more interesting to be able to incorporate a hidden Markov model approach, in which breakpoints between regions would be chosen organically from the data. We could then truly start questioning which parts of the genome behave in different ways, as opposed to being restricted to the 'trial and error' approach that is the essence of our method now.",

Due to the 3-periodicity of the genetic code, there are three global reading frames in which a sequence may code in the forward direction, henceforth referred to as GRF1, GRF2 and GRF3. In viruses these reading frames tend to encode simultaneously for up to three different overlapping genes on each strand, resulting in multiple coding regions. We will be looking at single stranded RNA viruses, which predominantly code in the forward reading direction only.

Say these genes code in GRFs 1 and 2 respectively. Let us first assume we already have an alignment between our two sequences, and we wish to understand the way selection works on different regions of the genome. An initial question to ask would be, whether single and double coding regions behave in the same way. We thus, as shown, partition the genome into five segments, making a split wherever a gene starts or stops. These five segments we then assign to be of one of three region-types: non-, single- and double coding. When considering the effect a mutation of the indicated nucleotide C in the overlapping region of S1 might have, we must consider its coding role in both reading frames. In GRF1 it is in the third position of the codon AGC and in GRF2 in the second position of the codon GCT. In the genetic code the codon AGx codes for serine or argenine, depending on whether x is a purine or a pyrimidine, respectively. On the other hand GxT codes for four different amino acids, depending on the nature of x. Therefore a transition in the nucleotide C will have no effect on the amino acid encoded by GRF1, whereas a transversion will. In GRF2 on the other hand, both will result in a non-synonymous substitution. Additionally, the selection strengths acting on either gene might be different, due to one of them evolving faster than the other.",

We may do this by taking the explicit derivatives of the likelihood function, possible because of the simple substitution model used. If we had opted for a more complicated model, we would need optimization methods that did not rely on derivatives and would subsequently be slower, though the estimation would still be possible. Once the change in log-likelihood between two iterations has fallen below some given threshold, we take the likelihood to have converged. We then generate a new emission matrix E to be fed back into our alignment procedure in order to generate new posterior probabilities.",

We could of course devise a multiple alignment indel model, and develop a new likelihood function from which to maximize over all tree branches simultaneously. This however would be of computational much higher demand, runtime increasing exponentially with the addition of each new sequence. Instead, we therefore opt to work with a multiple pairwise alignment under the assumption of a star shaped tree, with the reference sequence as the root in the star topology. This implies viewing the evolution of the pairwise sequences as independent, which is an approximation which we wish to address in future work. This merely requires per additional sequence an extra transition and transversion parameter, since selection is acting on the gene in the ancestor and we assume this to be constant over all branches. The modification to our program is thus trivial, with only a linear increase in runtime.",
