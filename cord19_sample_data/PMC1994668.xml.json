I had become fascinated by the novel opportunities that were becoming available through the sequencing of the human genome and the advent of high-throughput technologies such as DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry [1]. Because these technologies provided a way to obtain a nearly comprehensive view of a biological system, I was convinced they offered the best chance to learn everything there is to know about the complex interplay between viruses and the cells they infect. Over the past eight years, my laboratory has worked tirelessly, and even obsessively, to incorporate genomic, proteomic, and information technologies into our research. Although we certainly do not yet know everything there is to know about virus\u2013host interactions, we have made tremendous progress, and I remain convinced that genomic and proteomic approaches will be a fundamental force for pushing the field of virology forward in the years to come. In this paper, we provide a sampling of how we are using these technologies, the discoveries we have made, and how the technologies themselves have continued to evolve.",

Getting this new technology up and running required months of work. But after seemingly endless frustration, Gary Geiss was finally able to use these arrays, representing all of 1500 human genes, to evaluate the changes in cellular gene expression that occurred in a CD4+ T-cell line infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [2]. This was a straightforward study in which we analyzed two time points after infection, and we were thrilled to observe the temporal regulation of genes involved in T-cell signaling, subcellular trafficking, and transcriptional regulation. Despite how simplistic this study now appears, it was the first ever to apply genomics to AIDS research and it was the cover article when published in Virology. With the technology now in place, we were eager to apply it to a broad range of experimental systems. The possibilities seemed endless (as indeed they are), and we rapidly began \u201cdoing arrays\u201d on cells infected with a variety of different viruses or exposed to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), interferon, or other treatments (Fig. 1\n).",

This time, we profiled the cellular gene expression changes that occurred in HeLa cells infected with influenza virus, again analyzing two time points after infection [3]. In addition, we evaluated the cellular response to a heat-inactivated virus, allowing us to identify gene expression changes that were independent of viral replication. Genes involved in protein synthesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytokine signaling were induced by the replicating virus, and many of these changes suggested an active cellular antiviral response. Interestingly, viral replication also resulted in the down-regulation of many cellular genes, particularly at the later time point. The gene expression pattern induced by the inactivated virus included the induction of the cellular metallothionein genes, which may represent a protective response to virus-induced oxidative stress.",

Our dsRNA study identified 175 dsRNA-stimulated genes, which encoded proteins involved in a broad range of cellular functions and metabolic pathways. In addition, this study showed for the first time that many genes are also down-regulated by dsRNA. Our polysome fractionation studies, headed by John Kash, revealed that many of the cellular mRNAs that are recruited to polyribosomes during influenza virus infection are involved in the control of cell proliferation and survival, mitogenesis, or the inflammatory response. In addition, many of these mRNAs contain a putative binding site for GRSF-1, a cellular mRNA-binding protein that also specifically interacts with a discrete and conserved region of the viral 5\u2032 untranslated region [6].",

To identify markers associated with cirrhosis, genes that were differentially expressed in normal liver, or in HCC, were subtracted from the set of genes differentially expressed in cirrhotic livers. The resulting gene set included genes expressed in activated lymphocytes infiltrating the cirrhotic liver and genes involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, cell-cell interactions associated with cytoskeleton rearrangements, the anti-apoptotic pathway of Bcl-2 signaling, and the interferon response. Together, this analysis identified several potential gene expression markers of HCV-associated liver disease and contributed to our rapidly expanding database of experiments describing HCV pathogenesis.",

Our goals are to identify molecular processes influencing liver disease progression and to find potential gene expression markers of early fibrosis. To achieve these goals, we are working closely with clinicians in the liver transplant unit at the University of Washington, including Anne Larson, Robert Carithers, and James Perkins, to collect biopsy samples and to integrate the gene expression data obtained from these samples with clinical observations.",

Gene expression data were compared with clinical observations and with gene expression data obtained from 55 nontransplant HCV-infected and uninfected liver samples. Our analyses revealed several specific gene expression patterns, the first of which was unique for the transplant recipients regardless of their infection status. The corresponding genes encoded stress response proteins and blood proteins involved in coagulation that were differentially expressed in response to post-transplantation graft recovery. The second pattern was specific to HCV-infected samples and included the increased expression of genes encoding components of the interferon-mediated antiviral response and immune system. This pattern was absent or suppressed in the patients who developed early fibrosis, indicating that disease progression might result from an impaired liver response to infection. Finally, we identified gene expression patterns that were specific for the 12-month biopsy specimens of all four HCV-infected patients who developed early fibrosis after transplantation. The identified gene expression patterns may prove useful for diagnostic and prognostic applications in HCV-infected patients, including predicting early progression to fibrosis. We are continuing to collect and analyze biopsy samples as new patients are recruited into the study, which should enable us to obtain increasing levels of confidence in the predictive power of the markers that we identify.",

We found that global gene expression patterns vary significantly depending upon the etiology of liver disease and that stages of liver cirrhosis can be differentiated based on gene expression patterns in ethanol-induced, but not HCV-induced, disease. Many of the gene expression changes specifically observed in HCV-infected cirrhotic livers are associated with activation of the innate immune response. In contrast, we found that intrahepatic global gene expression profiles do not differ between HCV- and HCV/HIV-1 co-infected individuals. However, a specific gene expression pattern that may be associated with HCV-induced pathogenesis was identified. This pattern has similarities to the gene expression profiles in transplant patients who progress to fibrosis within one year of transplantation, suggesting it may also be relevant to predicting disease progression.",

This model, developed by Lorne Tyrrell and Norman Kneteman at the University of Alberta, Canada, is based on the severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID)-beige/albumin (Alb)-urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) transgenic mouse. Intrasplenic injection of freshly isolated human hepatocytes into these mice leads to the re-population of the mouse liver with human hepatocytes.

Because liver samples from these animals typically have small percentages of contaminating mouse liver tissue, she first evaluated the level of cross-hybridization of mouse liver mRNA to the human probes present on the microarray [16].

These results indicate that host genetic factors contribute to the variation in the host response to HCV, including the activation of innate antiviral signaling pathways. Mice with weak interferon responses also tended to have high levels of intrahepatic HCV RNA, indicating that an ineffective interferon response may allow increased levels of viral replication. These animals also accumulated higher numbers of differentially expressed genes than did mice with strong interferon responses.

Studies related to this virus, which killed and estimated 50 to 100 million people worldwide [30], have been (and remain) a prominent fixture of the laboratory, and genomic analyses are providing important new insights into what made this virus so lethal. In our first experiments associated with the 1918 virus, we evaluated global gene expression patterns in cells infected with wild-type influenza, engineered viruses lacking all or part of the NS1 gene, or with a virus containing the NS1 gene of the 1918 pandemic virus [31]. Deletion of the NS1 gene increased the magnitude of expression of cellular genes implicated in the interferon, NF-\u03baB, and other antiviral pathways, and a virus with a C-terminal deletion in its NS1 gene induced a cellular gene expression pattern intermediate between the patterns induced by wild-type and NS1 knockout viruses. In contrast, a virus containing the NS1 gene from the 1918 pandemic virus was more efficient at blocking the expression of interferon-regulated genes than its parental virus. Together, these results suggested that the cellular response to influenza virus is significantly influenced by the NS1 gene and that the 1918 NS1 is a particularly effective interferon antagonist. Of course, we have since learned that the story is much more complicated.",

Microarray analyses performed on lung tissues isolated from all infected animals showed the activation of many genes involved in the inflammatory response, including cytokine, apoptosis, and lymphocyte genes. However, consistent with histopathology analysis, the parental and 1918 HA/NA:WSN recombinant viruses showed increased expression of genes associated with activated T cells and macrophages, as well as genes involved in apoptosis, tissue injury, and oxidative damage that were not observed in mice infected with the New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN virus. These studies documented clear differences in gene expression profiles that were correlated with pulmonary disease pathology and suggested that an intrinsic property of the 1918 HA and NA proteins may be the production of a longer and more severe immune response culminating in a more destructive viral infection.",

The initial characterization of this virus by Terrence Tumpey and coworkers demonstrated that it was highly virulent in mice and most animals died within five days after infection [33]. Genomic analyses, led by John Kash, showed that animals infected with the reconstructed virus showed an increased and accelerated activation of genes associated with pro-inflammatory and cell-death pathways by 24 h after infection [34]. Significantly, these genes remained activated until the death of the animal. This was in contrast to less dramatic and delayed host immune responses (and less severe disease pathology) in mice infected with influenza viruses containing only subsets of genes from the 1918 virus. These findings indicate a cooperative interaction between the 1918 influenza genes and suggest that enhanced inflammatory and cell-death responses may contribute to severe immunopathology.",

The 1918 virus replicated to high levels and spread rapidly throughout the respiratory tract of infected animals, causing severe damage and masses of infiltrating immune cells throughout the course of infection. Genomic analyses revealed that the 1918 virus triggered an aberrantly high and sustained expression of numerous genes involved in the innate immune response, including proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The early and sustained host response in macaques infected with the 1918 virus was similar to what we observed in mice, indicating that critical host responses that influence disease outcome may occur very early after infection. Interestingly, the 1918 virus also appeared to selectively attenuate the expression of specific innate immune response genes, including certain genes associated with the type 1 interferon response. We have not determined the mechanism for this attenuation, but it is possible that the viral NS1 gene may play a role in regulating this response. Although the details remain to be uncovered, the atypical innate immune response induced by the 1918 virus was insufficient for protection and may actually contribute to the lethality of the virus.",
