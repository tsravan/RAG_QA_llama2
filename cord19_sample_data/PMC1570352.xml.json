            "text": "In fish, as in other lower vertebrates, the post-vitellogenic period is very important for the completion of the oogenetic process. During this step, the follicle-enclosed post-vitellogenic oocyte undergoes several key events such as the final acquisition of the ability to resume meiosis in response to the maturation-inducing steroid (MIS), the resumption of the meiotic process and, finally, its release from the surrounding follicular layers. In addition, the whole follicle (oocyte and surrounding follicular cells) undergoes a progressive differentiation ultimately leading to the release of a metaphase 2 oocyte. The key hormonal and molecular events involved in the control of meiosis resumption have been thoroughly studied and many studies have been dedicated to the action of gonadotropins, the regulation of steroidogenenic events and the action of the MIS (see [1-6] for review). However, the associated follicular or extra-follicular events involved in concomitant processes such as oocyte-follicular cells cross talk and ovulationmechanisms have received far less attention. Nevertheless, several researchgroups have studied the periovulatory ovarian physiology using classical biochemical or histological tools and, later, molecular approaches. Thus, several studies have dealt with ovarian proteases in their participation in the ovulatory process [7-9]. Differential display PCR and suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) approaches have also been developed in order to identify new differentially regulated genes in the fish periovulatory ovary [10-13]. In addition, numerous candidate gene studies have also been performed in the fish periovulatory ovary. Apart from genes related to hormonal controls, these studies were mostly dedicated to some specific gene families such as TGF beta family [14,15] or connexins [16,17]. Finally, fewer studies have simultaneously analyzed the expression profiles of several genes belonging to different families [18,19]. However, in contrast to other biological processes, such as immune response [20], the post-vitellogenic period has never benefited from genome-wide transcriptomic studies that could provide a global view of the molecular events occurring in the post-vitellogenic ovary undergoing oocyte maturation. In this context, the present study aimed at performing a transcriptomic analysis of the post-vitellogenic rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout ovary. In order to do so, 9152-gene rainbow trout cDNA microarrays were hybridized using RNA samples originating from rainbow trout ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. A statistical analysis was performed in order to identify all the genes exhibiting a differential expression over this period. In addition, a supervised clustering analysis was performed using only the differentially expressed genes in order to identify groups (or clusters) of genes exhibiting similar expression profiles. Furthermore, as a first step in a long-term transcriptomic analysis of the rainbow trout post-vitellogenic ovary, we deliberately chose to focus on 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression patterns. Finally, specific genes were selected in each cluster based on the novelty of their putative identity and/or function. For each gene, a real-time PCR analysis of their ovarian expression profiles was performed using additional ovarian RNA samples.",

Two year old female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were obtained during their first reproductive season from our experimental fish farm (Sizun, France) and held under natural photoperiod in a re-circulated water system in INRA experimental facilities (Rennes, France). The water temperature was kept constant at 12\u00b0C. Ovaries were sampled from individual females during late vitellogenesis (N = 6), post-vitellogenesis (N = 6) and during oocyte maturation (N = 6). Oocyte developmental stage was assessed under binocular microscope according to previously described criteria [21,22]. Late vitellogenic samples were collected at the end of the vitellogenic process, approximately 3\u20134 weeks before expected ovulation. At this stage, germinal vesicle is not visible and no polarized cytoplasm area can be observed. Post-vitellogenic samples were collected 2\u20133 weeks later but before any noticeable morphological changes in yolk structure due to the process of meiosis resumption. At this stage, oocytes can display a subperipheral or peripheral germinal vesicle. When germinal vesicle is not visible, a dark mass of polarized cytoplasm can be observed. Oocyte maturation samples were collected after meiosis resumption. Those samples were thus collected after yolk clarification and around the time of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). For tissue collection, trout were deeply anesthetized in 2-phenoxyethanol, killed by a blow on the head and bled by gill arch section. Ovaries were then dissected out of the body cavity under sterile conditions. Ovarian aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction.",

A first hybridization was performed using a 33P-labelled oligonucleotide (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG which is present at the extremity of each PCR product) to monitor the amount of cDNA in each spot. After stripping (3 hours 68\u00b0c, 0.1\u00d7 SSC, 0.2% SDS), arrays were prehybridized for 1 h at 65\u00b0C in hybridization solution (5\u00d7 Denhardt's, 5\u00d7 SSC, 0.5% SDS). Complex probes were prepared from 3 \u03bcg of RNA of each sample by simultaneous reverse transcription and labeling for 1 hour at 42\u00b0C in the presence of 50 \u03bcCi [alpha-33P] dCTP, 5 \u03bcM dCTP, 0.8 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 200 units M-MLV SuperScript RNase H-reverse transcriptase (GIBCO BRL) in 30 \u03bcL final volume.

Several over and under expressed clones belonging to three selected remarkable clusters, were selected according to their putative identity and/or function for analysis. Reverse transcription and real time PCR were performed as previously described [19]. Briefly, 3 \u03bcg of total RNA were reverse transcribed using 200 units of Moloney murine Leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and 0.5 \u03bcg random hexamers (Promega) per \u03bcg of total RNA according to manufacturer's instruction. RNA and dNTPs were denatured for 6 min at 70\u00b0C, then chilled on ice for 5 min before the reverse transcription master mix was added. Reverse transcription was performed at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour and 15 min followed by a 15 min incubation step at 70\u00b0C. Control reactions were run without MMLV reverse transcriptase and used as negative controls in the real-time PCR study. Real-time PCR experiments were conducted using an I-Cycler IQ (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Reverse transcription products were diluted to 1/25, and 5 \u03bcl were used for each real-time PCR reaction. Triplicates were run for each RT product. Real-time PCR was performed using a real-time PCR kit provided with a SYBR Green fluorophore (Eurogentec, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 600 nM of each primer. After a 2 min incubation step at 50\u00b0C and a 10 min incubation step at 95\u00b0C, the amplification was performed using the following cycle: 95\u00b0C, 20 sec; 60\u00b0C, 1 min, 40 times. For all primer pairs, the relative abundance of target cDNA within sample set was calculated from a serially diluted ovarian cDNA pool using the I-Cycler IQ software. This dilution curve was used to ensure that PCR efficiency was within an 80\u2013100% range and that amplification was linear within sample set. After amplification, a fusion curve was obtained using the following protocol: 10 sec holding followed by a 0.5\u00b0C increase, repeated 80 times and starting at 55\u00b0C. The level of 18S RNA in each sample was measured and used for target genes abundance normalization within sample set. In addition to the genes identified from the transcriptomic analysis, a widely used standard gene, elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1\u03b1), was monitored using the same sample set to validate the normalization procedure. GenBank accession number and primer sequences are shown in table 1. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 7.0 software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK). Differences between ovarian developments stages were analyzed using non parametric U tests.",

From the statistical analysis, 310 clones were found to exhibit a differential abundance between at least 2 of the studied ovarian stages (late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation). For all SAM analyses performed, the false discovery rate (FDR) was always lower than 0.7%. Among the 310 identified clones, 90 were up-regulated during oocyte maturation while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern. A clustering analysis was performed using only expression data of the 310 identified clones in order to characterize the expression profiles of those genes. The clustering analysis clearly separated the over from the under expressed genes (Figure 1). The number of each clone (1\u2013310) in the clustering analysis (Figure 1) was kept in subsequent tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and in the text. Within down-regulated genes, a cluster of 32 genes (cluster 1, Figure 1) was characterized by high expression levels during late vitellogenesis, low levels during oocyte maturation and intermediate or variable levels during post-vitellogenesis (Figure 1). Within up-regulated clones, a cluster of 44 genes (cluster 2, Figure 1) was characterized by a strong over expression at the time of meiosis resumption while a cluster of 14 genes (cluster 3, Figure 1) exhibited a very low expression during late and post-vitellogenesis and an up-regulation before meiosis resumption (Figure 1).",

However, the use of nylon cDNA microarrays is not very common in comparison to glass slide microarray technology. Nevertheless, this technology has successfully been used for several years [27,35]. In the present study we used similar cDNA manufacturing and hybridization protocols. While most of the 9152 clones used to generate the microarray putatively correspond to distinct genes, a small proportion of genes are represented by 2 distinct clones (e.g clones belonging to the same UniGene cluster). In our data, it is noteworthy that those clones are usually found in the same gene clusters (e.g clones #196 and 198, #199 and 200, #305 and 306). Since the position of clones in the clustering analysis is based on the correlation between their profiles, this indicates that they display very similar expression profiles. In addition, for all genes selected for real-time PCR analysis, the over or under expression observed was always consistent with microarray data. Furthermore, the expression of ef1\u03b1, a widely used reference gene, was stable over the preovulatory period. Together, these observations suggest that our overall microarray analysis is extremely robust and reliable.",

This observation is in total agreement with existing data on aromatase expression during this period [19,36]. In addition, a clone putatively encoding for a NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) was also located in cluster 1. The aromatase enzyme complex is formed from 2 principal protein components. CYP19a1 contains the catalytic domain that binds C19 steroid substrates in the proximity of the heme prosthetic group critical in the activation of molecular oxygen and subsequent substrate hydroxylation. The other essential component is the redox partner flavoprotein, NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. Interestingly, present data show that both transcripts exhibited an under expression during the rainbow trout preovulatory period, although it should be confirmed that the identified clone is coding for the oxydoreductase protein involved in the aromatase complex.",

One clone (# 194) was most similar to rat cytochrome P450 2J3 while the other one (# 202) putatively corresponded to rainbow trout cytochrome P450 1A3 (cyp1a3). Cytochrome P450 1A proteins are ubiquitous proteins that have been associated with the detoxification of several organic compounds such as PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl), PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons), and dioxin [37]. In fish, these compounds are able to induce cyp1a gene expression in a variety of tissues. In the rainbow trout immature ovary, a constitutive expression of CYP1A protein was previously reported [38]. Together, previous and present observations suggest that a CYP1A-related detoxification activity in the rainbow trout ovary. From the under expression of cyp1a3 gene observed in the ovary immediately prior to ovulation we could speculate that a decrease of the detoxification activity of the ovary is required before the beginning of the ovulation process. In addition, it was previously shown in rat C6 glioma cells that epoxygenases could inhibit prostaglandin E2 production [39]. Interestingly, C6 cells express epoxygenase mRNAs, CYP1A1, CYP2B1 and CYP2J3, which convert arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids; those epoxyeicosatrienoic acid being able to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase [39]. The role of prostaglandins in the ovulatory process has been thoroughly studied (see [40] for review). Thus, in rainbow trout, prostaglandin F2\u03b1 was able to induce in vitro ovulation [21,41]. Therefore, the observed down-regulation of cyp1a1 and cyp2j3 genes in the ovary prior to ovulation is therefore totally consistent with available data on the participation of prostaglandins in the ovulatory process.",

Real-time PCR data confirmed that rainbow trout aqp4 gene exhibited a strong over expression in the preovulatory ovary. In mammals, AQP4 is also known as mercurial insensitive water channel (MIWC). It was previously shown that water permeability was strongly increased in African clawed frog oocytes expressing MIWC [42]. In marine fish, a strong oocyte hydration occurs during oocyte maturation [43,44]. In addition, it was recently shown that this oocyte hydration involves an aquaporin1-like protein in seabream [45]. In freshwater species, data on oocyte hydration is more controversial. However, a limited but significant hydration was also observed in several freshwater species including rainbow trout [46]. Our data suggest that, similarly to marine species, the oocyte hydration occurring during oocyte maturation could also be aquaporin-mediated in freshwater species such as rainbow trout. In addition to aqp4 gene, we also observed a dramatic over expression of slc26 gene at the time of meiosis resumption. Solute carrier family 26 member 4 (slc26) is also known as sodium-independent chloride/iodide transporters or pendrin. The over expression of slc26 gene at the time of oocyte maturation is dramatic, as demonstrated by real-time PCR. Together, the strong up-regulation of aqp4 and slc26 genes at the time of meiosis resumption stresses the importance of water and ion transports in the rainbow trout preovulatory ovarian functions. In marine species, the major oocyte hydration occurring before ovulation is probably important for adjusting egg buoyancy. In contrast, in freshwater species laying demersal eggs such as rainbow trout, it has been hypothesized that the limited (25%) oocyte hydration occuring before ovulation could be necessary for the completion of the ovulation process [46]. Thus, the increase of oocyte volume could facilitate the rupture of the follicular walls and subsequently, the release of the oocyte from its follicular layers.",

Surprisingly, we observed that AVT precursor (avt) mRNA is expressed in the rainbow trout preovulatory ovary. To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence of non-neural expression of avt mRNA in fish.

In salmonid fish, several proteases have been identified in the periovulatory ovary [54]. In mammals, there is evidence that mature ovarian follicles contain proteolytic enzymes, including serine proteases. Indeed, serine proteases have been implicated in both ovulatory and inflammatory reactions (see [50] for review). In the present study, serine protease 23 (sp23) gene appears progressively up-regulated during the preovulatory period. To our knowledge, sp23 gene expression was never reported in the periovulatory ovary of any vertebrate species. However, we could speculate that this protease participates in the rainbow trout ovulatory process. Interestingly, our data showed that adam22 metalloprotease-disintegrin gene was sharply up-regulated at the time of oocyte maturation. The metalloprotease-disintegrin protein family (also known as ADAMs: A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinases) is thought to function in cell-cell interactions and in the proteolysis of luminal or extracellular protein domains. In mammals, several ADAMs family members are involved in the ovulatory process. In brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), metalloprotease activity increases in the ovary prior to ovulation [8,9]. Together, these observations also suggest that adam22 also participates in the rainbow trout ovulatory process.",

In Fish, however, several CXC have been identified but only CXCL12 and CXCL14 exhibit unambiguous orthologues [59]. In the present study, we showed that cxcl14 gene expression strongly increases during the preovulatory period. In catfish, RT-PCR data showed that cxcl14 gene was expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including the ovary [60]. In carp, quantitative PCR data showed that cxcl14 was predominantly expressed in the brain [61]. Despite its good conservation throughout vertebrate evolution [59], the number of studies addressing the in vivo role(s) of CXCL14 is limited. As a consequence, a lot of information is still unavailable in fish. In a murine model used to study Crohn's disease, cxcl14 expression is induced during inflammation [62]. Together, these observations suggest that cxcl14 gene expression induction contributes to the inflammatory-like events occurring in the rainbow trout at the time of ovulation.

According to these authors, several lines of evidences including biochemical and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the modern coagulation pathways found in mammals could also be functional in fish. Furthermore, it was previously shown that cultured rabbit macrophages were able to generate factor V procoagulant activity [64]. In the present study, we observed a dramatic increase of cf5 gene expression in the ovary during oocyte maturation. However, no significant difference was observed between late and post-vitellogenesis. From these observations we could speculate that, immediately prior to ovulation, the trout ovary secretes coagulation factors in order to prevent bleeding from ruptured ovarian follicles at the time of ovulation. Interestingly, the transcriptomic analysis showed that a transcript exhibiting sequence similarity with clotting factor C (Clone # 251, Table 3) was also over expressed immediately prior to ovulation.",

            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves Angiotensin I (Ang I) to form Angiotensin II (Ang II). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently described ACE homolog [65]. Both ACE and ACE2 are zinc-dependent peptidases of the M2-metalloprotease family. Within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 competes with ACE because it is capable of hydrolyzing Ang I into the nonapeptide Ang(1\u20139) [65]. In humans, ace2 gene expression was predominantly detected by Northern blot analysis in kidney, heart and testis [65,66]. In addition, a moderate expression was also observed in several other tissues including the ovary [66]. Using semi-quantitative RT PCR, a wide distribution was observed in rat tissues [67]. In mammals, previous observations suggested that the renin-angiotensin system was functional in the ovary. In cattle, a greater expression of Ang II was observed in large follicles. In addition, several lines of evidence supported the idea of Ang II in blocking the inhibitory effect of theca cells on meiosis resumption of bovine oocytes [68]. In brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) salmon Ang I and human Ang II were both able to increase the level of in vitro spontaneous ovulation [69]. In the present transcriptomic study, we observed a dramatic increase of ace2 gene expression during the preovulatory period. This observation was confirmed by real-time PCR data. Together, these observations suggest that the dramatic up-regulation of ace2 gene immediately prior to ovulation is important for the ovulatory process. In mammals, little is know about the role of ACE2 in the ovary. However, it is known in mammals that ACE2 can function as an Ang II degrading enzyme, forming the vasodilatator peptide Ang(1\u20137) [70,71]. Interestingly, a local vasodilatation is a key characteristics of the inflammatory response that is also observed during the mammalian ovulatory process (see [50] for review). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the observed increase of ace2 gene expression in the trout preovulatory participates in the vascular dynamics changes that are putatively occurring during the ovulatory process.",

In the present study we observed a significant decrease of cmah gene expression at the time of oocyte maturation.
