However, these static images do not reveal the dynamic movements within this complex macromolecule. The ribosome must coordinate multiple activities between spatially and functionally different sites in two subunits. These include three transfer RNA (tRNA)-binding sites, the peptidyltransferase and decoding centers and the elongation factor interacting regions. Events occurring in these regions must be carefully coordinated to assure rapid and accurate decoding of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Current efforts in the field are focusing on determining the mechanisms by which these functional centers synchronize their actions and communicate with each other.",

            "text": "The eukaryotic ribosome contains nearly 80 intrinsic proteins. The high degree of similarity across species, from the primary amino acid sequences to their tertiary structures, suggests conserved functional roles beyond serving as mere scaffolding for the rRNAs. Ribosomal protein L11 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential, highly conserved component of the 60S subunit (in bacteria and archaea, the homologous protein is named L5; the yeast nomenclature is used throughout this text to minimize confusion). At the primary amino acid sequence level, L11 is well conserved among eukaryotes (\u223c67\u201397% identity), while bacterial and archaeal L5 proteins are less well conserved (27\u201355% identical) (Supplementary Figure S1A). L11 is uniquely positioned at the interface between the large subunit central protuberance (Figure 1A and 1B) and the head of the small subunit (Figure 1A) (1\u20135). In the small subunit, the head region undergoes significant rotational movement relative to the central protuberance between the pre- and post-translocational states (6), and the protein\u2013protein interactions between L11 and S18 (S13 in bacteria and archaea) on the small subunit (the B1b and B1c intersubunit bridges) undergo the largest intersubunit structural rearrangements between these two states (7\u20139). These observations suggest that L11 may play a central role as an informational conduit between the two subunits. Detailed analysis of X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM structures (Figure 1B) reveals that the concave surface of the \u03b2-sheet portion of L11 interacts with specific nucleotides in the minor groove of 23S rRNA helix 84 (10). L11 also makes contacts with the helix III and loop C regions of 5S rRNA; these connections have been hypothesized to help stabilize 5S rRNA interactions and may participate in an information signal transmission network linking functional centers within the ribosome (1,11). Importantly, the B1b and B1c intersubunit bridges with S18 are the only protein\u2013protein interactions between the two subunits (2,3,5,8). Analyses of these structures indicate that contacts involving L11 and S18 through the B1b and B1c bridges break and rearrange after eEF-2 binding and ribosome ratcheting, controlled in part by differentially charged amino acid side chains between the two proteins (2,4,5,7,9,12). An internal loop of L11 that we denote the \u2018L11 P-site loop\u2019, which is roughly formed by amino acid residues 48\u201368, also directly contacts the T-loop of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site through tRNA nucleotide 56 (3\u20135). At the level of primary amino acid sequence, the P-site loop is highly conserved among eukaryotes (85\u2013100% identity), while it is less well conserved among bacteria and archaea (42\u201357% identity) (Supplementary Figure S1B). At the biochemical level, however, the P-site loop is significantly more homogeneous, containing a large number of well-aligned charged and aromatic amino acids. In particular, A50, F57, R60 and I65 (yeast numbering) are universally conserved. An alignment of the P-site loop structures from yeast, Haloarcula marismortui, Thermus thermophilus and Escherichia coli reveals that the P-site loop is extremely well conserved at the structural level (Supplementary Figure S1C).\n",

            "text": "In yeast, L11 is encoded by the paralogous genes RPL11A and RPL11B located on chromosomes 16 and 7, respectively (13). The 19-kDa proteins are 174 amino acids long and are identical except for an alanine (L11A) to threonine (L11B) difference at the third amino acid position. Analysis of L11 in the late 1980s (a.k.a. L16) showed that expression of either isoform was sufficient for cell viability (14). However, when expressed as the sole form of L11, RPL11A mRNA transcripts accumulated to only 33\u201340% of wild-type levels as compared to cells expressing both isogenes, while RPL11B mRNAs accumulated to 60\u201366%. Expression of either isogene alone also affected 60S subunit assembly: a strain expressing only L11B grew at wild-type rates but synthesized fewer 60S subunits than wild-type cells (although apparently not below a threshold necessary for wild-type growth rates), while strains expressing only L11A grew more slowly than wild-type, and synthesized only 33\u201340% of wild-type levels of total L11 and 60S subunits (14). A random mutagenesis screen of RPL11B for cold-sensitive mutants identified alleles that promoted 25S pre-rRNA processing and initiation defects (15). The specific mutants identified in that study were S34P, S41P, S97F, A98V, S119C and G135D. In Arabidopsis, divergent 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) between the two isogenes were found to result in differential expression among plant tissues (16). In addition to its function as a ribosomal protein, L11 has been implicated in p53 activation through its interactions with HDM2 in the nucleus of human fibroblast cells (17), and mutant forms of L11 have been linked to Daimond\u2013Blackfan anemia in humans (18).",

In this report, a series of mutants were generated using a reverse genetics approach to parse the role of the L11 P-site loop. Detailed biochemical and structural analyses focused on two multi-amino acid mutants with opposing effects on rRNA structure and tRNA binding. We propose that prior to peptidyltransfer, the presence of peptidyl-tRNA in the large subunit P-site positions the L11 P-site loop to interact with the Helix 84 of the large subunit rRNA. After peptidyltransfer, spontaneous translocation of the deacylated tRNA to the large subunit E-site allows the L11 P-site loop to extend into the P-site, breaking contact with Helix 84. By this model, we hypothesize that the L11 P-site loop functions locally as a sensor of the occupancy status of the ribosomal P-site.",

The L-A and M1 viruses were introduced into PSY2088 by cytoplasmic mixing (cytoduction) through nonproductive mating with JD758 [MATa kar1-1 arg1 (L-AHN M1)] to produce the Killer+ strain JD1313 as previously described (19). Wild-type RPL11B was isolated from yeast strain PSY2088 plasmid (pYCP50L11B URA3). Using flanking BamHI restriction sites, a 2.2-kb fragment of DNA containing both the 525-bp wild-type RPLL11B ORF plus the native 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR regions (1228 bp and 485 bp, respectively) was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. This 2238-bp fragment was ligated into BamHI digested pRS314, a low copy TRP1-selectable plasmid (purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) (22) to create pRS314L11B-TRP1. This plasmid served as the template for generation of rpl11B mutants by site directed mutagenesis using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Wild-type and mutant pRS314L11B-TRP1 clones were transformed into JD1313, selected for growth on \u2013trp medium, and cells having lost the URA3-based plasmid were identified by their ability to grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) (23).",

In this study, the reporters were housed in LEU2-based reporters: the 0 frame dual luciferase reporter was pJD419, the L-A dsRNA virus \u22121 PRF containing reporter was pJD420 and the Ty1 containing +1 PRF reporter was pJD421. Cells were grown overnight in 5-ml volumes of \u2013leu synthetic depletion media to mid log phase (A595 = 0.8\u20131.5). Cells were washed, resuspended in lysis buffer (1X PBS pH 7.4, 1 mM PMSF) and lysed using 0.5-mm glass beads with a vortex mixer for 3\u20135 min at 4\u00b0C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. at 8000 r.p.m. at 4\u00b0C. Samples were maintained on ice, and 5 \u03bcl of clarified lysate was added to 50 \u03bcl of pre-aliquoted Promega LARII reagent, mixed by pipetting, and read in a TD20/20 luminometer. Immediately upon completion of this read, 50 \u00b5l of Promega Stop and Glo buffer was added to the tube, pipetted to mix and read again. This was repeated 6\u201312 times per strain per reporter depending on the consistency of the data. Frameshifting rates were determined by taking the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferases for each sample, and then taking the ratio of the average ratios of the 0 frame samples to that of test reporter ratios to obtain the rates for both \u22121 and +1 PRF. These results were then analyzed by t-test to determine statistical significance compared to wild-type levels as previously described (25). Prior to determining rates of UAA readthrough (nonsense suppression), strains were cured of the endogenous yeast prion [PSI+] by daily serial passage of cells in -trp liquid media containing 5 mM guanidine hydrochloride for 10 days. Rates of nonsense suppression were determined as previously described (20) using the LEU2-selectable 0-frame control pJD419 and in-frame UAA containing reporter pJD702. Missense reporters were based on URA3 plasmids previously described for the sense reporter (20) and for the firefly luciferase 218 arginine codon (AGA) to serine (AGC) missense reporter plasmid pYDL-AGC (24). Methodologies were the same as those for other dual luciferase assays described above.",

Salt-washed ribosomes were thawed and activated at 30\u00b0C for 5 min. To monitor binding of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe to the A-site, 125 pmol of ribosomes were pre-incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min in 150 \u00b5l of A-Site Binding Buffer [80 mM Tris pH 7.4 160 mM NH4Cl, 15 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mM spermidine, 6 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol] containing 1.33 mM GTP, 0.25 mg polyU, 51 \u00b5g soluble binding factors generated as described (29) and 0.1 mg uncharged tRNAPhe. Subsequently, 12.5 pmol of ribosomes were added to 2-fold serial dilutions of [14C]tRNAPhe to a total volume of 30 \u03bcl and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 35 min. Samples were passed through Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA) nitrocellulose filters using a multi-sample vacuum manifold, filters were washed three times with 3 ml of A-site binding buffer and amounts of bound [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe were determined by scintillation counting. Background values (no ribosome controls) were subtracted from all samples. All strains were tested at least twice in triplicate. Kd values were calculated using GraphPad Prism Software fitted to 1-site binding with ligand depletion formula. To examine binding of Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe to the P-site, 150 pmol of ribosomes were resuspended in 150 \u00b5l of P-Site Binding Buffer [80 mM Tris pH 7.4 160 mM NH4Cl, 11 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mM spermidine, 6 mM \u03b2-me] plus 0.25 mg polyU.

Filter binding assays and determination of steady-state Kd values were performed as described above. Multiple turnover peptidyltransfer reactions utilized 250 pmol of ribosomes pre-loaded with Ac-Phe-tRNAPhe by incubating for 40 min at 30\u00b0C with 256 pmol of Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe in 300 \u03bcl of binding buffer (BB) [80 mM Tris pH 7.4 160 mM NH4Cl, 11 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mM spermidine, 6 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol] including 0.17 mg of polyuridine. Puromycin was added to each 100-ml reaction to a final concentration of 25 mM, samples were incubated at 30\u00b0C and 10 \u03bcl samples were taken at 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 40- and 60-min time points, added to 90 \u03bcl binding buffer plus 100 \u03bcl of 1 M NaOH to stop the puromycin reactions. Two 5-\u03bcl aliquots were taken from each sample and added directly to 5 ml of scintillation fluid to determine total possible counts. Peptidylpuromycin products were extracted into 400 \u03bcl of ethyl acetate, half of which were added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid for counting. Data were plotted by counts per minute versus the percentage of N-Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAphe reacted. Kobs was determined by plotting first-order time plots using the formula: ln[100/(100 \u2013 x)] where \u2018x\u2019 is the percentage of tRNA reacted.

After transformation and selection on SD medium lacking tryptophan (\u2013trp), cells expressing only mutant rpl11B alleles were identified by their ability to grow on SD\u2013trp medium containing 5-flouroorotic acid (5-FOA). Three of the multiple substitution mutants were inviable as the sole forms of L11B. These were R51YTVRTFGIR60\u2192alanine (i.e. 51-60A); deletion of residues 51-60 (51-60\u0394); and F57GIR60\u2192alanine (57-60A). Viable mutants, R51YTV54\u2192alanine (51-4A), V54RTF57\u2192alanine (54-7A), R51A, Y52* (mutations including \u0394, A, R, E, S, I, Q, N, H and F), F57A and R61A were rescued from yeast into E. coli, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.",

Growth at 30\u00b0C represents the ideal temperature, and thus all other conditions were compared to this baseline. At 30\u00b0C, the 51-4A mutation conferred depressed growth while 54-7A displayed roughly wild-type growth. Cold sensitivity was assessed at 20\u00b0C and both mutants grew at wild-type rates. 51-4A showed enhanced growth at 37\u00b0C relative to itself at 30\u00b0C, while mutant 54-7A was similar to wild type. R51A grew at wild-type rates at 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C but showed enhanced growth at 20\u00b0C.

This study utilized three such molecules: paromomycin, anisomycin and sparsomycin. The effects of all three drugs were monitored using dilution spot assays at 30\u00b0C on SD\u2013trp media containing various drug concentrations. Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that increases translational error rates by artificially stabilizing codon:anticodon interactions at the decoding center in the small ribosomal subunit (31). As compared to their intrinsic growth in the absence of drug, both the 51-4A and 54-7A mutants were slightly hypersensitive to 2 mg/ml paromomycin, as were Y52\u0394, Y52N and Y52H. In contrast, R51A, F57A and R61A were all paromomycin resistant (Figure 2B). Anisomycin competes with the 3\u2032 end of the aa-tRNA for binding to the A-site pocket of the ribosome (32,33). Both 51-4A and 54-7A showed anisomycin resistance at 40 \u00b5g/ml, as did several Y52* mutants, and R61A (Figure 2B). Sparsomycin binds to the P-site and interferes with peptidyl-tRNA binding and peptidyl transfer (33,34). 51-4A and 54-7A mutants were hypersensitive to 30 \u00b5g/ml sparsomycin, as were most of the Y52* mutants, with the exception of Y52F, which conferred slight resistance to this drug (Figure 2B).",

Changes in \u22121 PRF efficiency alter the ratio of Gag to Gag-pol, and inhibit the ability of cells to maintain M1 (19). To monitor the effects of the mutants on Killer virus maintenance, colonies of JD1313 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant rpl11B alleles were spotted onto a lawn of diploid, Killer\u2212 indicator cells. Cells expressing wild-type RPL11B were Killer+ as demonstrated by their ability to inhibit growth of the indicator cells (Figure 2C).

Rates of +1 PRF were monitored using a cis-acting signal derived from the Ty1 retrotransposable element using pYDL-Ty1. Baseline +1 PRF efficiencies in cells expressing wild-type RPL11B were 10.98% \u00b1 0.30%. 51-4A had no effects on +1 PRF, while 54-7A promoted a small but statistically significant increase (1.18 \u00b1 0.06-fold of wild type; Figure 3). Significant changes in +1 PRF were also observed in the Y52A, Y52S, Y52N, Y52E, Y52H and Y52F mutants. mRNA decoding occurs in the small subunit decoding center, and changes in termination codon recognition (nonsense suppression) is another indicator of altered translational fidelity. pYDL-UAA (39), which contains an in-frame termination codon immediately 5\u2032 of the firefly luciferase gene, was used to monitor this parameter. The baseline rate of nonsense suppression in cells expressing RPL11B was 0.137% \u00b1 0.003%. The 51-4A mutant slightly improved this aspect of translational fidelity, with nonsense suppression levels decreasing to 0.88 \u00b1 0.04-fold of wild-type levels. 54-7A did not affect UAA recognition (Figure 3). Y52\u0394, Y52A, Y52S, Y52N, Y52E and Y52H all promoted increased rates of nonsense suppression ranging from 1.31- to 1.78-fold wild type. pYDL-AGC218 tests missense suppression levels by monitoring rates of incorporation of an arginine (AGA) near-cognate amino acid instead of a cognate serine (AGC) at the catalytic codon 218 within the firefly luciferase gene as previously described (24). Thus, in this assay, mis-utilization of near-cognate tRNAArg at the Ser AGC codon restores firefly luciferase activity. Wild-type missense levels were measured at 0.074% \u00b1 0.002, comparable to previous studies (24). Mutant 51-4A had significantly higher levels of missense suppression (measured at 1.21 \u00b1 0.03-fold wild-type), while 54-7A did not significantly affect this phenomenon (1.07 \u00b1 0.04 fold wild type) (Figure 3).

In all strains the 60S peak was smaller than that of the 40S fraction which can be attributed to the presence of only a single copy of RPL11B, which has previously been shown to effectively reduce the number of 60S subunits produced by the cell to 60\u201366% of true wild-type levels while having no visible phenotypic effect on growth (14). No significant differences were observed among the samples (data not shown). Phenotypic variation in PRF and in the presence of anisomycin and sparsomycin are indicative of altered interactions between the ribosome and tRNAs. P-site tRNA Kd values were determined in vitro by binding 2-fold serial dilutions of N-acetylated-[14C]Phe-tRNA to ribosomes until saturation was achieved (Figure 4A), and the resulting data were used to determine steady-state single site binding Kd values (Figure 4B). Wild-type ribosomes bound this P-site substrate with a Kd of 72.3 \u00b1 7.9 nM. The 51-4A mutants promoted a slight increase in affinity for P-site substrate (Kd = 50.9 \u00b1 11.2 nM), while 54-7A had the opposite effect (Kd = 89.3 \u00b1 10.4 nM). Given the physical interaction between the L11 P-site loop and peptidyl-tRNA, it was imperative to determine whether the observed small changes in P-site affinities promoted by the mutants were biochemically significant. To this end, multiple turnover puromycin reactions were performed. In these experiments, puromycin was added to ribosomes pre-incubated with excess P-site substrate, i.e. Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe, and accumulation of the peptidylpuromycin product was monitored over time. In these reactions, the first round of peptidylpuromycin synthesis is very rapid. Next, in a slow step, the ribosome intrinsically translocates the deacylated tRNAPhe into the E-site (40), followed by the slow diffusion of Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe into the P-site where it can react with puromycin. Repetition of this cycle results in slow multiple rounds of product synthesis (Figure 4C). Assuming that the L11 mutants do not affect either rates of intrinsic translocation or of Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe diffusion into the P-site, changes in product accumulation, i.e. Kobs, should be due to differences in binding affinities for the P-site substrate. Consistent with this model 51-4A promoted 1.46 \u00b1 0.14-fold increased Kobs relative to wild-type ribosomes, while 54-7A decreased Kobs to 0.51 \u00b1 0.01-fold that of wild type (Figure 4D). To assay for changes in tRNA binding to the A-site, steady-state Kd values were determined in vitro by binding 2-fold serial dilutions of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe to ribosomes pre-loaded with uncharged tRNAPhe in the P-site. Wild-type Kd values were 103 \u00b1 11 nM. 51-4A promoted decreased affinity for the substrate with a value of 150 \u00b1 19 nM, while 54-7A promoted a small increase in affinity (84 \u00b1 7 nM) (Figure 4E and F).\n",

To test this, SHAPE (41\u201343) was employed to probe for structural alterations in selected regions of the 25S, 18S and 5S rRNAs due to either the L11B mutants or in wild-type ribosomes with occupied or unoccupied P-sites.

The most significant changes in rRNA structure were observed in bases C2675-A2679 (E. coli numbering: C2306-2310) located in the terminal loop of 25S rRNA H84 (Figure 5A and E). The two mutants promoted opposing patterns of base protection/deprotection in this structure. Specifically, as compared to wild-type ribosomes, 51-4A promoted enhanced protection of this loop, while the loop was deprotected in the 54-7A mutants. Analysis of the recent cryo-EM yeast ribosome structure (4) revealed that these H84 loop bases are located within 3 \u00c5 of the stretches of amino acids changed to alanines in both the 51-4A and 54-7A mutants (Figure 5B). These findings suggested that the two mutants had the effects of displacing the P-site loop into two opposing conformational states: extended toward the P-site (54-57A), or retracted into H84 (51-54A). To test whether these two states are naturally dependent on P-site occupancy, the experiments were repeated with wild-type and mutant ribosomes with or without tRNAPhe in their P-sites. Consistent with this model, addition of tRNA to the P-site of wild-type ribosomes resulted in slightly enhanced protection of the H84 terminal loop bases closest to the P-site loop (A2676-A2679). Interestingly, C2675 showed significant deprotection when the P-site was occupied by tRNA. This base is on the far side of the terminal end of H84 from the P-site loop, suggesting that H84 itself alters its conformation upon tRNA occupancy of the P-site (Figure 5C). 51-4A\u2019s H84 bases were unchanged between P-site bound and unbound ribosomes, consistent with the P-site loop positioned in the \u2018retracted\u2019 state in this mutant, although small differences in the protection patterns suggest that the P-site loop is in a slightly different orientation in this mutant. In contrast, while 54-7A ribosomes, i.e. the P-site loop \u2018extended\u2019 state, showed deprotection at all bases (C2675-A2679) for both P-site bound and salt washed ribosomes, bases A2676-A2679 were less deprotected when tRNA was in the P-site and C2675 was even more reactive, consistent with the notion that the P-site loop interacts with H84 when peptidyl-tRNA is in the P-site.\n",

Similarly, all single amino acid changes explored here resulted in viable cells, suggesting a certain degree of biochemical/biophysical redundancy within this essential loop. In support of this notion, the strongest growth phenotypes observed across a range of temperatures and small molecule translational inhibitors were concentrated in the multiple alanine substitutions, i.e. 51-4A and 54-7A, thus directing the bulk of the biochemical and structural analyses to these two mutants.",

This is modeled in Figure 6. When the P-site is unoccupied, the P-site loop can extend into this space, moving away from the terminal loop of H84. Upon occupation of the P-site, the peptidyl-tRNA T-loop displaces the L11 P-site loop, causing its retraction into H84. By this model, the rRNA SHAPE analyses depicting increased protection of Helix 84 by the 51-4A mutant show that this mutant drives the L11 P-site loop equilibrium toward the \u2018retracted\u2019 state. Conversely, increased deprotection of Helix 84 in the 54-7A mutant suggests that this more mimics the P-site unoccupied state, i.e. the \u2018extended\u2019 P-site loop state. This analysis directly explains the P-site binding data. Retraction of the P-site loop from the P-site results in 51-4A ribosomes having higher intrinsic affinity for this substrate while extension of this structure into the P-site creates a steric clash with the peptidyl-tRNA T-loop, resulting in decreased affinity for this substrate. That neither mutant conferred optimal peptidyl-tRNA P-site occupancy may account for their hypersensitivity to sparsomycin, especially for 54-7A in which the P-site loop is already competing with the tRNA for the P-site. Mutants 57-60A, 51-60A and 51-60\u0394 appear to disrupt the normal function of the P-site loop to a lethal level. In addition, the observation that tRNA binding to the P-site results in deprotection of C2675 implicates H84 itself as a structurally dynamic unit. The functional consequences of this are not clear, although it is tempting to speculate that this conformational change may play a role in the structural rearrangements of the B1b and B1c bridges between the pre- and post-translocational states.\n",

The reciprocal effects between Ac-aa\u2013tRNA binding with the P-site and aa\u2013tRNA interactions with the A-site are intriguing. In the aa\u2013tRNA binding reactions, the ribosomal P-sites were occupied with daeacylated tRNA. We suggest that in the 51-4A mutant, the P-site ligand is more \u2018locked\u2019 into a suboptimal conformation, which in turn feeds back to the A-site, resulting in decreased affinity for its ligand. Conversely, the lessened ability of 54-7A mutant ribosomes to lock P-site ligand in a suboptimal conformation may account for the increased affinity of these ribosomes for A-site ligand. Anisomycin resistance by both mutants also followed the reciprocal P-site/A-site pattern, i.e. both mutants were sparsomycin hypersensitive. Paromomycin interacts with the decoding center in the small subunit, where it promotes misreading of near-cognate codons in the A-site by stabilizing codon\u2013anticodon interactions (45). This sensitivity may be attributable to an observed increase in missense incorporation of a near cognate arginine (AGA) over that of the sense serine codon (AGC) in mutant 51-4A. Intriguingly, 54-7A had wild-type levels of missense incorporation suggesting that its sensitivity to paromomycin was indirect. The reciprocal anisomycin/paromomycin phenotypes of the L11 mutants demonstrate the effects of this protein on A-site ligand based ribosomal functions over very long distances. Similar phenotypic patterns were previously observed with mutants of other large subunit components (46,47).",

This is consistent with the observed increased rates of missense decoding in this mutant. Conversely, post-slippage A-site tRNAs are even less stable in the 54-7A mutants, leading these to be more efficiently proofread, and thus promoting decreased \u22121 PRF efficiency. In both cases, altering \u22121 PRF from the optimum \u2018golden mean\u2019 precludes these cells from maintaining the yeast killer virus (19,48).

            "text": "The changes in rRNA stability observed in the terminal loop of Helix 88 and in ES31 are intriguing. Chemical protection experiments revealed the terminal loop of Helix 88 is involved in a kissing loop interaction with the terminal loop of Helix 22, and this interaction is apparent in the X-ray crystal and cryo-EM structures (4,49). Increased lability at A2779 and A2780 was previously observed in the Y11C mutant of ribosomal protein L10 (homolog of E. coli L16) located at the base of the aa\u2013tRNA accommodation corridor, and in the \u03a82922C (E. coli U2554) 25S rRNA mutant located in the peptidyltransferase center (50,51). The observation that mutations located in three very different and topologically distinct regions of the large subunit conferred similar structural effects suggest that this kissing loop interaction plays an important role in ribosome function. Its location on the cytoplasmic face of the ribosome where deacylated tRNA leaves the molecule implies that the interaction between the terminal loops of Helices 88 and 22 may be involved in gating this deacylated tRNA exit corridor open and closed. This is consistent with the model of allosteric coordination between the A- and E-sites (52,53), which would indicate that the defects conferred by all of these mutants on aa\u2013tRNA binding might impair this E-site gating function. The decreased lability of C2531 and G2534 in ES31 is similarly intriguing, raising more questions than answers. No function is currently associated with this expansion segment, but recent cryo-EM analysis shows it to be located on a solvent accessible surface of the large subunit (4). Perhaps this site is also involved in A-site/E-site coordination. Alternatively, it may be a site for recognition of defective ribosomes by the nonfunctional ribosome decay apparatus.",
