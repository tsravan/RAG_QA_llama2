In 1998, Katzenstein and Myers proposed four histopathologically distinct subgroups of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) and a closely related pattern termed respiratory bronchiolitis-associated ILD, acute interstitial pneumonia (formerly Hamman-Rich syndrome), and non specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) [4]. In 2002, an international multidisciplinary consensus classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias was proposed by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) [5]. This classification defined a set of histologic pattern that provided the basis for clinico-radiologic-pathologic diagnosis, with the final pathologic diagnosis being made after careful correlation with clinical and radiologic features. However, as discussed in several reports, the classification schemes of adult ILD are not satisfactory for the pediatric cases which seem to comprise a broader spectrum of disorders with a more variable clinical course [6]. In addition, pediatric histologic patterns often do not resemble pathologic features of lung tissues from adults and some forms are only observed in children younger than 2 years.",

Recently, an additional group has been introduced which is based on the concept that some pediatric ILD are observed more frequently in infants, while others are more specific to older children. The last ERS monography on ILD provided a chapter on pediatric classification which is based on a clear distinction between children aged 0-2 years and children over 2 years-old [7]. Indeed the stage of lung development and maturation should be taken into consideration when approaching a diagnosis of pediatric ILD. In this view, a new term \"diffuse lung disease\" has recently been introduced that comprises a diverse spectrum of lung disorders with impaired gas exchange and diffuse infiltrates by imaging. These disorders, more prevalent in young children, include diffuse developmental disorders, lung growth abnormalities, neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, surfactant dysfunction disorders, disorders related to systemic diseases, disorders of immunocompromised host, and disorders of normal host caused by various insults such as aspiration syndrome or infections [8]. Some diseases are mostly observed in older children such as systemic diseases, idiopathic disorders as described in adults (DIP, UIP, NSIP and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP)), unclassifiable ILD and also infectious disorders [9].",

            "text": "It is important to point out that the pathologic processes underlying the so-called diffuse lung diseases involve not only the alveolar structure but also the distal part of the small airways and the conducting zone, i.e. the terminal bronchioles. Terminal bronchioles are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium containing Clara cells, basal cells and a limited number of ciliated cells. Clara cells secrete nonsticky proteinaceous compounds to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles, which constitute the quiet zone between the conducting and the respiratory lung zones [10]. The terminal bronchioles are surrounded by a spiral of smooth muscle. Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form respiratory bronchioles which contain a small number of alveoli. Consequently, the term of diffuse lung disease refers to disorders that can affect both the distal part of the conducting and the respiratory lung zones, and include ILD as well as pathological processes leading to obstruction/obliteration of small airways [8]. Therefore, diffuse lung diseases encompass a broader group of diseases than ILD which refers to disorders that affect the respiratory function of the lung and consequently the pulmonary structure responsible of the diffusion of gases between blood and air (i.e. the alveolar epithelium, the interstitium, and the pulmonary capillary endothelium).",

From the limited published data composed mainly of case reports and small series, it seems that pediatric ILD occurs more frequently in the younger age and in boys [11].

Indeed, for a long time, chronic ILD and pulmonary fibrosis were believed to result mainly from chronic inflammation following an initial injury to the alveolar epithelial lining [15,16]. In cases of limited injury, it was thought that the reparative attempt could reverse the trend toward fibrosis. By contrast, in situations of continuing injury, the repair process driven by inflammatory molecules produced by the local cells will result in scarring and structural changes. Therefore, by targeting the inflammatory response, the belief was that fibrosis could be prevented or controlled. This theory explains the large use of anti-inflammatory therapy with, however, limited clinical efficacy.",

            "text": "Based on clinical and experimental observations, a new paradigm has progressively emerged with the alveolar epithelium being viewed as a key actor in the development of ILD [17-19]. Following injury, alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) may actively participate in the restoration of a normal alveolar architecture through a coordinated process of re-epithelialization, or in the development of fibrosis through a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [20]. Complex networks orchestrate EMT leading to changes in cell architecture and behaviour, loss of epithelial characteristics and gain of mesenchymal properties. The reasons for epithelial cell loss and inappropriate re-epithelialisation are still debated, but ongoing apoptosis is believed to be a key component in the progression of the disorder [21]. Prolonged denudation of the basement membrane contributes to altered interactions and cross-talk between AECs and mesenchymal cells, resulting in profound modifications of cell functions with imbalanced production of oxidants, proteases, and polypeptide mediators including cytokines and growth factors such as Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and Endothelin (ET)-1. A consequence is the perpetuation of a vicious cycle with TGF-\u03b2 promoting epithelial cell apoptosis, which in turn increases the local production of TGF-\u03b2 [22]. ET-1 is also considered to be an important actor, based on the current knowledge of its numerous functions including fibroblast and smooth muscle cell mitogen, and stimulant of collagen synthesis [23,24]. Recent studies showed that ET-1 is produced by AEC, and could induce alveolar EMT via stimulation of endogenous TGF-\u03b2 production.",

Downstream events linked to upregulation of TGF-\u03b2 include modifications in the expression of various components of the cell cycle machinery, mainly the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) system that plays an essential role in ensuring proper cell cycle progression. Recently, much work has been focused on the protein p21cip1, a member of the CDK inhibitor family. This protein promotes cell cycle arrest to apoptosis in cases of cellular DNA damage. Interestingly, upregulation of p21cip1 has been reported in the lung tissues of patients with pulmonary fibrosis, primarily in hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells [27] The increased expression of p21cip1 can favour the process of epithelial cell apoptosis. Apoptotic cells can also produce TGF-\u03b2. A consequence would be the perpetuation of a vicious cycle with TGF-\u03b2 promoting epithelial cell apoptosis, which in turn increases the local production of TGF-\u03b2.",

Selman and coworkers reported that lung fibrosis is characterized by enrichment for genes associated with cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, smooth muscle differentiations, and genes associated with lung development [28-31]. During EMT in the embryonic period, cells undergo a switch from a polarized epithelial phenotype to a highly motile mesenchymal phenotype [32]. Molecular processes governing EMT are induced by a cooperation of receptor tyrosine kinases or oncogenic Ras (RTK/Ras) pathway and TGF-\u03b2 signaling [33]. Recently, additional pathways and effectors have been reported to play a role in the induction of EMT, such as Wnt//\u03b2-catenin, Notch and Sonic hedgehog signalling [34].",

Situations associated with abnormal regulation of the cascade of events leading to the formation of mature protein result in either misfolding or mistargeting of the protein. These events trigger induction of intracellular aggregate formation and ER stress, which can lead to cell death through apoptosis and autophagic pathways [36,37]. Several stimuli including oxidant-antioxidant imbalance, viral proteins, inflammatory molecules, nutrient deprivation may induce ER stress [38,39] (Figure 2). Among the cytoprotective mechanisms available are the ER chaperones such as binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). Interestingly, mutant BiP mice have been reported to die within several hours of birth from respiratory failure due to impaired secretion of pulmonary surfactant by type 2 AEC. In these animals, expression of surfactant protein (SP)-C was reduced and the lamellar bodies were malformed, indicating that BiP plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of surfactant [40]. Several recent reports suggest the possible implication of ER stress in ILD, with activation of stress response markers in fibrotic lung tissues.",

Among them are genetic defects with mutations in SP-B gene (SFTPB) as well as genes coding for SP-C (SFTPC), ABCA3, and TTF-1 [41-43]. More than 30 SFTPB (located on chromosome 2) mutations have been identified among patients with a congenital deficiency in SP-B. For SFTPC located on chromosome 8, at least 35 mutations have been described, localized primarily in the COOH- terminal Brichos domain [44,45]. A proposed function of the Brichos domain is a chaperone-like activity, which could prevent misfolding and aggregation of the parent protein. Alterations in the Brichos domain could therefore lead to diseases through mechanisms related to abnormal protein processing and cell toxicity [46]. Recently, several studies have also documented the role of ABCA3 deficiency in ILD. ABCA3 functions in the transport of surfactant lipids into lamellar bodies and is required to maintain pulmonary surfactant phospho-lipid homeostasis. Another contributor of ILD is TTF-1 (NK2 homeobox 1) dysfunction. TTF-1 is a critical regulator of transcription for the surfactant protein SP-B and SP-C. It is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 14q13 and is composed of three exon and two introns [47]. It is expressed in the thyroid, brain and lung.",

            "text": "Stem cell dysfunction represents a new domain of investigation. Alveolar epithelium regeneration and repair requires activation and proliferation of tissue-resident (progenitor) cells and their differentiation to replace the damaged cells [48]. However, unlike cancer cells, stem cells are not immortal and display decreasing telomere length with aging [49]. Telomere shortening has been documented to be associated with reduced capacity for stem cell renewal, and decreased activity of telomerase, the polymerase responsible for telomere maintenance. The stem cells of the alveolar epithelium are the type 2 AEC, and expression of telomerase has been documented in these cells [48]. Experimental studies have also indicated that telomerase is expressed mainly during lung development with a peak expression before birth followed by a decrease to nearly undetectable levels in mature alveolar epithelium. Interestingly, telomerase expression and activity could be reinduced in normal quiescent type 2 AEC exposed to oxidative stress [50]. The current understanding is that a population of type 2 AEC may have the capacity to survive injury through telomerase activation, and consequently may be responsible for repopulation of the damaged alveolar epithelium. On the basis of reports of pulmonary disorders in dyskeratosis congenita (a rare hereditary disease of poor telomere maintenance), recent and exciting findings have documented mutations in the telomerase gene in familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [51]. In addition, it is likely that environmental factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, or virus infection may modify telomerase activity and account for the development of organ-specific disease associated with telomerase dysfunction. In this view, new data in chronic respiratory diseases support the concept that alveolar stem cell dysfunction may play an important role in the rate of progression or severity in ILD [52]. The question whether telomerase mutations or telomere dysfunction may be implicated in pediatric ILD needs to be addressed in prospective studies, one possible tool being determination of telomere length in circulating leukocytes.",

            "text": "The frequency of lung fibrotic disorders is much lower in children than in adults. Some clinical situations have features certainly unique to children, but many of these diseases overlap their adult counterparts with the primary event being injury and damage of the alveolar epithelium [11,13]. Yet, the overall outcome and prognosis of the diseases in children are thought to be less severe than in adult patients. In addition, pediatric ILD is more responsive to therapeutic strategies than adult ILD [9]. These differences may be explained by the types of initial injury, which may not be similar due to changes in the host environment. Another explanation is the modifications of the process of wound healing with age. Comparison of the response to injury in foetal and adult skin shows clear differences [53]. Skin wound healing in the foetus is characterized by complete regeneration of the skin and the absence of scar formation. Progressively with age, the skin looses the capacity to regenerate the original tissue architecture with the result being scar formation that extends outside the wound bed. The process of healing involves the coordinated regulation of cell proliferation and migration and tissue remodeling, predominantly by polypeptide growth factors [54]. The slowing of wound healing that occurs in the aged may be related to changes in the activity of these various regulatory factors. In a study on the role of aging in the development of cardiac fibrosis in the rabbit, differences in the cascade of events leading to myocardial remodeling were observed, with mainly the presence of more myofibroblasts synthesising collagen and expressing high levels of TGF-\u03b2 in older animals [55]. A study of growth factors involved in skin wound healing in young and aged mice also showed age-dependent changes. Expression of all the fibroblast growth factors was diminished in aged mice, even in healthy skin. In addition, the post-wound regulation of expression of these factors and of TGF-\u03b2 was less pronounced and slower than in young mice. These findings are in agreement with data observed in muscle that indicated significant alterations in the TGF-\u03b2 production with age [56,57]. Other potential mechanism is linked to the observation that injury in adult tissues does in certain circumstances stimulate tissue regeneration, depending on the presence of small subsets of primitive stem cells. Stem cells are the self-renewing, primitive, undifferentiated, multipotent source of multiple cell lineages [49]. While such cells are critical for development and growth through childhood, residual pools of adult stem cells are hypothesized to be the source of the frequently limited tissue regeneration and repair that occurs in adults [58]. Unlike embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells are not immortal, and show decreasing telomere length with increasing age. The naturally limited replacement capacity of such endogenous stem cell pools may occur via exhaustion of the stem cell pool or arise as a consequence of inherited or acquired mutations that alter proper stem cell function [59]. The limited life span of cells may result from replicative senescence in response to various stresses including DNA damage, oxidants, and telomere erosion [52]. All these forms of injury have been documented in the lung from adult patients with ILD.",

There is a male predominance with a sex ratio of 1.4. The presenting clinical manifestations are often subtle and non-specific. The onset of symptoms is, in most cases, insidious and many children may have had symptoms for years before the diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. However, the majority of patients has symptoms for less than one year at the time of initial evaluation. The clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic presentation with radiological features suggestive of ILD to more characteristic presence of respiratory symptoms and signs such as cough, tachypnea and exercise intolerance [9,60]. These varying presentations are also reflected in the report published by Fan et al. who systematically evaluated the clinical symptoms and physical findings of 99 consecutive children with ILD [2]. Common symptoms at presentation included cough, dyspnea, tachypnea and chest wall retraction, exercise limitation and frequent respiratory infections. Cough is observed in almost 75% of the patients, is normally non-productive and does not disturb sleep. Tachypnea is observed in 80% of patients and is usually the earliest and most common respiratory symptom. Unexplained fever is also reported in almost one third of infants. Failure to thrive (37%), tiring during feeding and weight loss are also common symptoms, mainly in young patients. Although a history of wheezing may be elicited in almost 50% of the patients, wheezing is documented by physical examination in only 20% of the cases.",

Large subpleural air cysts in the upper lobes adjacent to areas of ground-glass opacities have been also reported in young children with ILD. These cysts are interpreted as paraseptal or irregular emphysema. HRCT is useful for ILD diagnosis and selection of lung area to be biopsied. It is proposed that it also may contribute to monitor disease activity and/or severity. However, evaluation is still needed to support a role of HRCT as a follow up tool in pediatric patients.",

Generally, in ILD, pulmonary function abnormalities reflect a restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced lung compliance and decreased lung volumes [67-69]. Vital capacity (VC) is variably diminished; the decrease in total lung capacity (TLC) in general is relatively less than in VC. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is also reduced but relatively less than VC and TLC, and residual volume (RV) is generally preserved; thus the ratios of FRC/TLC and RV/TLC are often increased. Airway involvement is observed only in a minority of patients. Lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) or transfer factor (TLCO) is often markedly reduced and may be abnormal before any radiological findings. However, DLCO corrected for lung volume may also be normal in many children. Hypoxemia as defined by a reduced resting arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) or a reduced resting arterial oxygen tension is often present. Hypercarbia occurs only late in the disease course. During exercise the above described dysfunctions become even more pronounced. Thus, gas exchange during exercise might be a more consistent and sensitive indicator of early disease [3].",

Besides infections, BAL can be of diagnostic value in several situations. In the context of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, BAL abnormalities are characterized by milky appearance fluid, abundant proteinaceous periodic acid schiff positive material, and presence of foamy alveolar macrophages (AM) [70]. BAL can also be diagnostic for pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage [11]. This diagnostic is easy when the BAL fluid has a bloody or pink color, but its gross appearance may be normal. Microscopic analysis may then be of value by documenting the presence of red blood cells in AM or haemosiderin laden AM [71]. Among other situations, the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis can be performed with the use of the monoclonal antibodies revealing the presence of CD1a positive cells (in more than 5% of the BAL cells) [72]. Lipid disorders with lung involvement represent another indication of BAL. This includes congenital lipid-storage diseases (Gaucher's disease and Niemann-Pick disease) or chronic lipid pneumonia due to chronic aspiration [73,74]. However, in cases of aspiration syndromes, the presence of lipid laden AM is sensitive but not specific [75].",

DIP is characterized by airspaces filled with AM, thickened alveolar septa, scattered mixed inflammatory cells and minimal fibrosis. Many alveolar spaces are lined by hyperplastic type 2 AEC. Recently, association with surfactant disorders has been reported [41,84-86]. NSIP encompasses a broad spectrum of abnormalities with varying degrees of alveolar wall inflammation or fibrosis. The cellular pattern of NSIP is characterized by mild to moderate interstitial chronic inflammation and type 2 AEC hyperplasia in inflammation areas. It has been reported in a variety of underlying conditions including connective tissues diseases and surfactant disorders. LIP features include a marked diffuse infiltrate of mature lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes within the pulmonary interstitium, particularly the alveolar walls. They are often associated with either connective tissues disorders or immunodeficiency states, both congenital and acquired [9]. Another pattern described mainly in adults is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which includes diffuse homogeneous thickening of alveolar interstitial walls with myofibroblast accumulation, prominent type 2 AEC hyperplasia and atypia, and hyaline membranes containing surfactant proteins and cellular debris [87]. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is rare in children [88]. It is characterized by severe remodeling of the alveolar structure with heterogeneous appearance consisting of contiguous areas of normal lung, dense scarring, and bronchiolar abnormal proliferation. Interstitial inflammation is usually mild to moderate. Histologic patterns of ILD unique to infancy are described below.",

In children, HP is often associated with exposure to antigens in the home environment as well as with certain hobbies. The most frequent types of HP include bird fancier's diseases, humidifier lung diseases, and chemical lung diseases. Bird fancier's diseases are induced by exposure to birds with the antigens being glycoproteins in avian droppings, and on feathers. Importantly, respiratory symptoms in exposed patients who have only one pet bird at home should raise the suspicion of HP [96]. Humidifier lung diseases (air conditioner lung, misting fountain lung, basement lung diseases) are caused mainly by free-living amoeba and nematodes, as well as bacteria and fungi. Chemical lung diseases can be induced by various inorganic antigens such as those from vaporized paints and plastics. Low-molecular-weight chemicals may react with proteins in the airways, thus forming complete antigens. Once exposure history is obtained, additional information is required and includes biologic tests allowing measurements of environmental contaminants and interpretation of the results by environmental medicine experts.",

Children can develop subtle interstitial inflammatory reactions in the lung without noticeable symptoms for months [97]. Clinical features in the classic form include non productive cough, dyspnea, malaise, asthenia and occasional cyanosis [95]. Lung function abnormalities are not specific and appear similar to changes observed in other ILD. HRCT abnormalities vary from ground glass attenuation predominantly in the mid-upper zone to nodular opacities with signs of air-trapping [62,63,98]. Laboratory tests focus mainly on the search for serum-precipitating IgG antibodies against the offending antigen [95]. However, the presence of these antibodies is considered to be of questionable clinical relevance for diagnosis, as it is observed in up to 50% of serum samples of exposed but asymptomatic individuals. BAL cell profile study typically shows an increase in total cell count with a remarkable elevation in the percentage of lymphocytes often over 50% with a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio [95,97]. However, in contrast to studies in adults, the CD4/CD8 ratio could be within the normal range for children [76].

The diagnosis is further supported by positive blood tests for cytoplasmic-staining (c)-ANCA PR3 type [114].",

The principle component of the basement membrane is type IV collagen which can be expressed as 6 different chains, from alpha1 to alpha6. The Goodpasture antigen has been localized to the carboxyl terminus of the noncollagenous domain of the alpha3 chain of type IV collagen. The anti-GBM antibody can usually be found in serum [117].

The causative role of the virus in the initiation of the disease remains uncertain, but it may be an important factor in its progression as treatment with corticosteroids may make patients more susceptible to adenovirus infection or reactivation from latency. E1A has been shown to increase the production of TGF-\u03b2 and to induce lung epithelial cells to express mesenchymal markers, thereby contributing to remodeling of the alveolar structure [145]. Isolation of the virus from the throat and serologic studies are diagnostic supportive, but the diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of the virus in lung tissues.",

The role of RSV in the physiopathology of theses disorders as well as and the mechanisms of its persistence remain to be elucidated [149]. Interestingly, in a recent work on the histopathology of untreated human RSV infection, the presence of the virus in AEC has been documented [150].

PAP is described as primary or secondary to lung infections, hematologic malignancies, and inhalation of mineral dusts. Recently, the importance of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the pathogenesis of PAP has been documented in experimental models and in humans. GM-CSF signaling is required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant. In PAP, disruption of GM-CSF signaling has been shown, and is usually caused by neutralizing autoantibodies to GM-CSF. Therefore, the emerging concept is that PAP is an autoimmune disorder resulting in macrophage and neutrophil dysfunction. In a recent report, it has been reported that GM-CSF autoantibodies are normally present in healthy individuals, but at lower levels than in PAP patients [171]. In addition, in vitro experiments indicated that these autoantibodies reduce GM-CSP signaling similarly in healthy individuals and in PAP patients. At levels above a critical threshold, GM-CSF autoantibodies are associated with multiple impaired GM-CSF dependent myeloid function [172]. Several cases of genetic defects in the common beta chain for the GM-CSF receptor have been documented [173].",

The capillary meshes are wrapped over the alveoli, with only a single sheet of capillaries between adjacent alveoli on the same alveolar duct. Impaired development of this vascular network can be caused by genetic defects, prematurity or injury. Aberrant angiogenesis documented in pediatric patients include mainly alveolar capillary dysplasia, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis [178]. Alveolar capillary dysplasia is a rare disorder, presenting with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn [179]. The strongest diagnostic features are poor capillary apposition and density, allied with medial arterial hypertrophy and misalignment of pulmonary vessels [180]. Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is also a rare disease that is characterized by proliferation of capillary-sized vessels within the alveolar walls of the lung [181]. Intimal thickening and medial hypertrophy of the small muscular pulmonary arteries are present resulting in elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Most cases appear sporadic. Chest imaging shows nodular pulmonary infiltrates and septal lines. A definitive diagnosis can be made only by histologic examination. Interestingly, capillary proliferation in the alveolar wall has been reported in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [182].",

The human airway epithelium contains highly specialized pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNEC) system. It's function remains unknown but is hypothysed to act in modulation of fetal lung growth and in post-natal stem cell condition [199]. The PNEC system permits synthesis and release of serotonin and neuropeptides such as bombesin [200]. As normal bombesin levels decrease after mid-gestation, its overexpression in NCHI could be attributed to a non-regression of neuroendocrine cells [201]. Clinical presentation is typically a respiratory distress in post-natal young infant (mean age 3.8 months in a large serie, but cases in older children have been reported [202]. HRCT shows patchy centrally ground-glass opacifications and air trapping [203]. On lung biopsy, the histological abnormality is hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells within bronchioles documented by bombesin immunohistochemistry. The follow-up reveals in some cases the persistence of tachypnea and oxygen requirement for several months. Usually, there is a good prognosis [7,8,196,202].",

Among the anti-inflammatory agents used in pediatric ILD, steroids are the preferred choice, administered orally and/or intravenously. This has been well illustrated by the results of the ERS Task Force on pediatric ILD [9]. Oral prednisolone is most commonly administered at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day [1]. Children with significant disease are best treated with pulsed methylprednisolone at least initially [61,204]. This is usually given at a dose of 10-30 mg/kg/day for 3 days consecutively at monthly intervals. The minimum number of cycles recommended is 3 but treatment may need to be continued for a longer period of 6 months or more depending on response. When the disease is under control, the dosage of methylprednisolone can be reduced or the time between cycles can be spaced out. The disease may then be controlled with oral prednisolone preferably given as an alternate day regime. In few cases oral prednisolone is used from the beginning simultaneously with intravenous methylprednisolone but this is only recommended in those with very severe disease. Methylprednisolone may be effective when other forms of steroids administration fail without significant side effects.",

Individual case reports have described a response to hydroxychloroquine even in the presence of steroid resistance [1,205,206]. Some groups have proposed to base the decision as to which agent to use on the lung biopsy findings, with a preference for steroids in case of large amount of desquamation and inflammation and for hydroxychloroquine if increased amounts of collagen representing pre-fibrotic change are found. However, as documented in the ERS Task Force on pediatric ILD, the preferred choice between steroids or hydroxychoroquine in children is highly dependent on the expertise of the center in charge of the patient, and does not seem to be oriented by the histopathological pattern [9]. In case of severe disease, steroids and hydroxychloroquine may be associated. In situations of inefficiency of steroids and hydroxychloroquine, other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic agents such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or methotrexate may be used. These treatments have been used mainly in situation of autoimmune disorders.",

Although the mechanisms and cellular targets specific to macrolide activity remain to be elucidated, beneficial effects in several chronic lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and cystic fibrosis have been reported [207,208]. Of interest is the ability of macrolides to accumulate in host cells including epithelial cells and phagocytes. In a recent report, a favorable response to treatment with clarithromycine has been described in an adult patient with DIP [209]. Other new therapeutic strategies currently proposed in adult patients target fibrogenic cytokines. The Th1 cytokine interferon-\u03b3 has an antifibrotic potential through suppression of Th2 fibrogenic functions. Antagonists to TGF-\u03b2 include pirfenidone and decorin. The use of molecules directed against TNF-\u03b1 such as the soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptor agent etanercept is also under investigation. To date, there are no reports on the use of these novel therapies in pediatric ILD. Finally, in the coming years, it is likely that an expanding number of molecules aimed at favoring alveolar surface regeneration and repair through activation and proliferation of tissue-resident (progenitor) cells will come out.",

Reports in pediatric ILD have not shown a good correlation between histological findings and outcome. Some children with relatively severe fibrosis on lung biopsy make good progress, whereas others with mild desquamation have a poor outcome. This is probably due to the variable severity of the disease in different parts of the lung especially in relation to the particular area biopsied, despite HRCT guidance. Overall a favorable response to corticosteroid therapy can be expected in 40-65% of cases, although significant sequelae such as limited exercise tolerance or the need for long-term oxygen therapy are often observed.

The (Endoplasmic Reticulum) ER and its protein maturation machinery allow the synthesis of mature secretory and membrane proteins with specific folded conformation. In situations of stress induced by genetic mutations or environmental factors, unfolded or misfolded proteins are retained in the ER and induce a defence mechanism called the ER stress response. The induction of ER chaperones is critical to increase the ER folding capacity allowing the production of correctly folded protein. When this defence mechanism is impaired, the misfolded proteins can either be degraded by the proteasome or form protein aggregates. Protein aggregates are toxic and can cause conformational diseases. Within the alveolar epithelium, misfolding of SP-C could trigger induction of intra-cellular aggregate formation and ER stress, with consequently development of alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD and conformational disease.",
