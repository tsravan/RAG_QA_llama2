The authors described the first 32 documented patients with pandemic influenza A H1N1 (PIAH1N1) virus infection hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Spain. Twenty-four patients (75.0%) had refractory hypoxemia and required advanced mechanical ventilation. Eight patients (33.3%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation at ICU admission. Six of these patients (75%) required further orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation and two (33%) died.",

On the other hand, NIV may increase the risk of respiratory pathogen transmission [2] and there is not enough evidence to support the treatment of ALI/ARDS with NIV. To date, three studies have suggested that NIV has not been successful in critically ill patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure attributable to PIAH1N1 virus infection [1,3,4]. In these studies a total of 76 patients received NIV, but 64 (84.2%) of these patients required subsequent intubation and invasive ventilation.",

We agree that NIV is not recommended for patients with respiratory failure due to PIAH1N1 virus infection. However, several points should be clarified. Use of NIV in ARDS remains controversial and the etiology of hypoxemia seems to be an important determinant of successful outcome. Our results describe our national clinical practice in the current pandemic and it is consistent with other reports [3,6]. Other authors have recently reported that, in centers with expertise on NIV, 30% of patients with ARDS were treated with NIV as a first-line intervention and 30 to 50% of these avoided orotracheal intubation [1,3,6]. Thus, only a small number of patients with ARDS benefited from NIV in expert centers, always needing close monitoring in the ICU setting. In selected patients with milder presentation a conservative ventilator approach should be considered until additional data from 2009 PIAH1N1 is obtained.",
