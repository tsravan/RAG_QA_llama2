Outbreak and epidemic control requires swift action, but real-time identification and characterization of epidemics remains difficult [1]. Methods are needed to inform real-time decision making through rapid characterization of disease epidemiology, prediction of short-term disease trends, and evaluation of the projected impacts of different intervention measures. Real-time mathematical modeling and epidemiological analysis are important tools for such endeavors, but the limited public availability of information on outbreak epidemiology (particularly when the outbreak creates a crisis environment), and on the characteristics of any novel pathogen, present obstacles to the creation of reliable and credible models during a public health emergency. One needs to look no further than the 2003 SARS outbreak, or ongoing concerns related to highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) or bioterrorism to be reminded of the need for and difficulty of real-time modeling.",

For every epidemic, there is a suitable time point after which a given phase of an outbreak can be suitably modeled, and beyond which subsequent phases may be anticipated.

This population size is assumed to have saturation in growth as the outbreak progresses, and this saturation can be caused by immunity, by implementation of control measures or other factors such as environmental or social changes (e.g., children departing from schools for summer holiday). The basic premise of the Richards model is that the incidence curve of a single phase of a given epidemic consists of a single peak of high incidence, resulting in an S-shaped cumulative epidemic curve with a single turning point for the outbreak. The turning point or inflection point, defined as the time when the rate of case accumulation changes from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) can be easily pinpointed as the point where the rate of change transitions from positive to negative; i.e., the moment at which the trajectory begins to decline. This time point has obvious epidemiologic importance, indicating either the beginning of a new epidemic phase or the peak of the current epidemic phase.",

This variant of Richards model provides a systematic method of determining whether an outbreak is single- or multi-phase in nature, and can be used to distinguish true turning points from peaks and valleys resulting from random variability in case counts. More details on application of the multi-staged Richards model to SARS can be found in [6,7]. Readers are also referred to [8,9] for its applications to dengue.",

Onset dates represent best local estimates, and may be obtained differently in different jurisdictions. For example, the province of Ontario, which comprises approximately 1/3 of the population of Canada, and where most spring influenza activity was concentrated, replaces onset dates using a hierarchical schema, whereby missing onset dates may be replaced with dates of specimen collection (if known) or date of specimen receipt by the provincial laboratory system, if both dates of onset and specimen collection are missing.",

The PHAC cumulative case data is then fitted to the cumulative case function C(t) in the Richards model with the initial time t0 = 0 being the date when the first laboratory confirmed case was reported and the initial case number C0 = C(0) = 1, (the case number with onset of symptoms on that day). There were some differences between sequential epidemic curves in assigned case dates. For example, data posted by PHAC on May 20 indicated an initial case date of April 13, but in the June 3 data this had been changed to April 12, perhaps due to revision of the case date as a result of additional information.",

As such, for comparison, we fit our model using the time series for 2009 pH1N1 hospitalizations in Canada posted by PHAC on July 15 [11] (that last date these data were made available) (Table 3). This time series was easily fit to a one-phase model (Figure 2). Further examples of using hospitalization or mortality data to fit the Richards model can be found in [14].",

In most model fits, April 28-29 and May 4-7 were identified as early turning points for the outbreak, with a third and final turning point around June 3-5 in models based on longer time series. Although this modeling approach was not able to detect turning points using some earlier data sets (e.g., those limited to the period from April 12 to May 27), in general the turning points identified were consistent across multiple models and time series. Perhaps the most important divergence between models occurred with the detection of an April 29 turning point in the case report time series, but not in the time series based on hospitalized cases. We believe this may be attributable to the small number of hospitalizations, relative to cases, that had occurred by that date, as well as the fact that hospitalization data only became available on April 18.",

This quantity has direct policy relevance; for example, in the autumn 2009 pH1N1 wave in Canada, vaccination for pH1N1 was initiated at or after the turning point of the autumn wave due to the time taken to produce vaccine; as the epidemic was in natural decline at that point, the impact of vaccination has subsequently been called into question.",

With respect to the lag between final turning points using a 2-phase model for case data (June 4) (Table 1, last line) and a 1-phase model using hospitalization data (June 11), this lag in turning points would actually be expected, due to the time from initial onset of symptoms until hospitalization, which was reported to have an interquartile range of 2-7 days in a recent study from Canada [15]. Timelines for the 2-phase model for case data of 4/12-6/19 and the 1-phase model for hospitalization data are presented graphically in Figure 3.",

Our estimates of R0 is smaller than that derived by Fraser et al.

However, changes in phase (signified by the presence of turning points identified using the Richards model) may also pinpoint the timing of important changes in disease dynamics, such as effective control of the epidemic via vaccination or other control measures, depletion of disease-susceptible individuals (such that the effective reproductive number for the disease decreases to < 1), or the peak of a \"seasonal\" wave of infection, as occurs with both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One of the advantages of the Richards model for real-time modeling is that it offers a simple means of fitting a model to cumulative case counts, which smoothes out stochastic variations in the epidemic curve.",

As we also demonstrate here, the Richards model produces fairly stable and credible estimates of reproductive numbers early in the outbreak, allowing these estimates to inform evolving disease control strategies. For example, the first estimates in Table 1, derived using early case data accessed on May 20, closely approximate our final estimates (Table 1, last row). Thus, while early estimation with the Richards model failed to correctly detect turning points or accurately estimate the final outbreak size, it was nonetheless useful for rapid estimation of R0 within a month of first case occurrence in Canada.",

In our current study, the hierarchical approach used by Canada's most populous province (Ontario) for replacement of missing data could have had distorting effects on measured disease epidemiology: the replacement of missing onset dates with dates of specimen collection could have resulted in the artifactual appearance of early turning points identified by our model, due to limitations in weekend staffing early in the outbreak. If, as we believe to be the case, public health laboratories did not have sufficient emergency staffing to keep up with testing on weekends such that weekend specimen log-ins declined sharply, this would have created the appearance of epidemic \"fade out\" on weekends. Other factors that might distort the apparent epidemiology of disease include changes in guidelines for laboratory testing of suspected cases, improved surveillance and public health alerts at later stages of the outbreak leading to increased case ascertainment or over-reporting of cases [20]. However, the quality of the time series will tend to improve with the duration of the epidemic, both because stochastic variation is \"smoothed out\", and also because small variations become less important as the cumulative series becomes longer. We note that a further application of the Richards model in the context of influenza would relate to comparison of the epidemiology of the 2009 influenza A H1N1 epidemic to past Canadian epidemics, though such an endeavor is beyond the scope of the present study.",
