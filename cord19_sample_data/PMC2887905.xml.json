HIV-1 entry can therefore be inhibited by heparan sulfate [4], its analogs [5] or other synthetic polyanions [6], ligands for CD4 [7], CXCR4 [8] or CCR5 [9], and by factors that bind to gp120 like neutralizing antibodies [10]. Since HIV-1 variability is prodigious, viral escape to all these antiviral substances has been documented and therefore there is a pressing need to find new strategies to efficiently block HIV-1 infection.",

PMN from patients with hereditary myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency indicated that the antiviral activity was correlated with the presence and the release of the enzyme into cell culture medium. Adding MPO to PMN-(MPO-deficient) cell cultures restored the ability to block HIV-1 infection [11,12]. In addition to MPO, the presence of two other factors, H2O2 and chloride, was absolutely necessary to observe the antiviral activity in cell culture supernatants of stimulated PMN cells. Since the enzyme MPO catalyzes the reaction between H2O2 and chloride to generate HOCl (bleach), Klebanoff and coworkers [12] suggested that this product of the MPO/H2O2/halide system was directly responsible for HIV inactivation. A clue as to the substrate of the MPO/H2O2/halide system was provided by the detection of HOCl-modified proteins in human tissue by a specific monoclonal antibody (clone 2D10G9) [13]. This antibody recognized an HOCl-modified protein in glomerular and tubulointerstitial inflammatory and fibrotic lesions and its binding was inhibited by HOCl-modified human serum albumin (mHSA) [14,15].",

Low doses of HOCl-modified human serum albumin (mHSA) inactivated WNV entry into VeroB4 cells in vitro and we observed an interaction between mHSA and the domain III of the WNV external envelope. Similar to WNV, HIV-1 also enters its target cell following membrane fusion of the viral envelope and the plasma membrane and it is conceivable that enveloped viruses share common functions to promote membrane-membrane contact to allow binding of cell membrane-anchored receptors.",

In brief, freshly prepared HOCl was added to an aqueous solution of serum albumin (1 gr/liter phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.5). The concentration of HOCl was monitored by UV spectroscopy (\u03b5 = 375 mol/cm liter). Serum albumin was treated with HOCl at different molar ratios (serum albumin:HOCl, 1:10, 1:20, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:10000). After incubation for 30 min at RT, remaining HOCl was inactivated by adding the antioxidant 2 aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine, final concentration 5 gr/l). The mixture was incubated again for 30 min at RT. Purification of the HOCl-modified serum albumin and the elimination of remaining 2 aminoethanesulfonic acid was achieved by concentrating the reaction mixture to a final volume of 50 ml by ultrafiltration (GE Healthcare, hollow fibre column UFP-10-C 3X2MA, membrane nominal-molecular-weight cutoff 10 kD) and then further purified by a continuous ultrafiltration process using the QuixStand\u00ae apparatus (GE Healthcare). A total volume of 20 litres of water was slowly added over a time period of 48 h to purify the mHSA product which was continuously pumped over the hollow fibre column at a maximum pressure of 15 PSI. After this ultrafiltration process the solution (400 ml) was again concentrated to a final volume of 50 ml. The final yield of HOCl-modified serum albumin was between 250-500 mg/50 ml (i.e. 25-50%).",

Virus and mHSA were added to the cells simultaneously. The cultures were assessed microscopically 5 days after infection by visualization of induced syncytia and cell layer destruction. To visualize syncytia, cell layers were treated with 3% formalin for 10 min to inactivate virus and then fixed with methanol (Solution 1 of the Azur B and Eosin G based Hemacolor\u00ae rapid staining set, Merck, Germany) for 5 min. After fixation, cells were stained with color reagent red (solution 2 of the Hemacolor\u00ae staining set) for 30 sec followed by a staining with color reagent blue (solution 3 of the Hemacolor\u00ae staining set) for 30 sec. Alternatively, HeLa-P4 cells, cultured in DMEM/10% FCS, expressing human CD4, CXCR4 were transfected with 1 \u03bcg pSVATGrev plasmid. This plasmid expresses the gp160 protein precursor, which is processed and expressed on the outside of the cellular membrane as the functional gp120/gp41 complex. Cells were transfected for induction of syncytia and mHSA was given to the cells 30 min after transfection. Syncytium formation was assessed after 28 h by standard phase contrast microscopy.",

In HIV-1 cell cultures, infected cells fuse with other, non-infected CD4+ target cells. Cell-cell fusion is known as syncytium formation. Syncytium formation is the result of the binding of gp120, which is present on membranes of the infected cells, to the receptors on the target cells and subsequent insertion of the gp41 N-terminus into the host membrane. This gp120-receptor binding event promotes recurring cell-cell fusion which leads to the generation of large syncytia. The mHSA samples generated with low HOCl concentrations (molar ratios HSA:HOCl 1:10 and 1:50) showed no inhibitory effect on syncytium formation (Figure 1). At higher concentrations (molar ratio 1:100) an inhibitory effect of mHSA was detected with 90% inhibition at a concentration of approximately 50 \u03bcg/ml. The mHSA samples produced at molar ratios 1:1000 and 1:10.000 showed strong inhibition with 90% at 10 \u03bcg/ml and complete inhibition of gp120-induced syncytium induction at 20 \u03bcg/ml. Thus, HSA treated with higher concentrations of HOCl is transformed into an antiviral form in contrast to HSA samples treated with low HOCl doses.",

Using these three serum albumin preparations, we studied binding of mHSA, mBSA and mMSA to LAV (NL4-3) gp120 by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) (Figure 2a, c, e). The experiment demonstrated that serum albumin modified by a 1000-fold molar excess of HOCl bind to the immobilized gp120. No binding of mHSA, mBSA and mMSA to gp41 immobilized on a biosensor (binding < 5 RU, data not shown) was observed. Thus, binding was specific for gp120 envelope. Bound protein was removed from the gp120-biosensor by treatment with 100 mM HCl and 100 mM NaOH. This regeneration procedure retained the ability of immobilized gp120 to bind rCD4 and V2- and V3-loop specific antibodies. Also no binding to gp120 was measured using normal, non-modified HSA, BSA and MSA (Figure 2b, d, f). In these control experiments response units (RU) in SPR were also below 5 RU. Binding of HOCl-modified proteins was compared to gp120-binding of rCD4 and gp120-specific antibodies (Figure 2g). At 50 \u03bcg/ml the modified proteins showed between 50-70% of the gp120 binding activity observed with rCD4 at 10 \u03bcg/ml. Binding of antibodies generated by immunization with CHO-derived SF2-gp120 (Serum ADP429) or by a V3 loop peptide (IRIQRGPGRAFTIGC) (mab EVA 3047) showed binding responses at 1:80 dilution (Serum ADP429) or 25 \u03bcg/ml (mab EVA 3047) about 30 40 times as high as the HOCl-modifed serum albumins at 50 \u03bcg/ml.",

As shown before [16], mHSA binding is also specific to the West Nile virus domain III and does bind to similar domains of Yellow Fever and Dengue-2 virus, respectively. Since mHSA also binds to WNV envelope, we suggest that the binding of HOCl-modified serum albumin to HIV-1 or WNV envelope is neither a highly epitope specific event nor does it mirror a fundamental, yet undiscovered, molecular step of the WNV or HIV-1 entry process. Such non-specific binding events are common in many other pathogen-host interactions. For example malaria parasites use negatively charged chondroitin-sulfate-proteoglycan (CSPG) structures to attach to the membrane surface of their host cells [19]. For HIV-1, heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan (HSPG) is such an attachment factor [20] and heparan sulphates as well as other polyanions are efficient inhibitors of HIV-1 infection [21,22]. Our current hypothesis is that pathogens which coat their core particle with the membrane of the host cell need a simple mechanism to attach to cells possessing an identical membrane structure. This membrane-membrane contact must be mediated by the external envelope glycoprotein complex present in the viral membrane and might be a first non-specific binding event to initiate the next step, binding to specific receptors.",

            "text": "Masking the envelope complex to prevent membrane attachment seems to be a simple mechanism to prevent viral entry. The blockade of CD4 and V3-loop antibody binding by mHSA supports this hypothesis. The masking by mHSA completely inhibited rCD4 binding and partially inhibited the V3-loop antibody binding, indicating that a large and important proportion of the gp120 molecule is masked by mHSA. The surface of gp120 is per se covered by complex carbohydrate structures, which represent more than 55% of the gp120 molecular weight. Especially the elimination of the carbohydrate structure g15 within the V3 loop plays an important role in viral entry and these mutants showed higher infectivity. Due to higher infectivity, these viruses can escape from neutralizing antibodies present in human sera [23]. An interesting advantage of mHSA is the ability to neutralize these antibody resistant viruses. A more efficient neutralization of such viruses by mHSA might be the result of the lack of N-glycan g15 that renders the V3 loop more exposed. Such an unmasked V3 loop seems to be a better binding target for HOCl-modified albumins since the binding of V3-loop-specific neutralizing antibodies was blocked by mHSA. Masking the CD4 and V3 loop area by mHSA was also efficient for the blockade of CCR5-specific infection, but 3 times higher levels were necessary compared to the neutralization of CXCR4-viruses. Thus, V3-driven selection for higher infectivity of CXCR4 viruses or the switch from CCR5- to CXCR4-usage is not beneficial for promoting escape from mHSA neutralization. Blocking both coreceptor pathways is an important step to block HIV-1 transmission. In an evolving epidemic, CXCR4-tropism is present in high frequency among all HIV-1 subtypes except subtype C [24,25]. The high frequency of CXCR4-tropism, 86% that was found in subtype A and CRF02_AG in patient samples from West Africa, demonstrates that a topical microbicide has to inhibit CXCR4-viruses frequently present in HIV-1 infected individuals. On the other hand, cervico-vaginal tissue preferentially supports the productive infection by CCR5-tropic viruses [26]. Thus, a microbicide has to block both coreceptor pathways to prevent HIV-1 sexual transmission. The HOCl-modified serum albumins, when applied as a topical microbicide, can be applied in an adequate concentration (>200 \u03bcg/ml) that is high enough to block both viruses completely.",

Viral infection assays in cell culture have the advantage that cell culture ingredients such as (i) antioxidants present in fetal calf serum or (ii) free amino acids like methionine or cysteine present in cell culture medium at 0.2 M are present during the test period. In addition, the mHSA samples produced with low amounts of HOCl showed no inhibitory effect indicating that potential traces of taurine or HOCl are not contributing to the inhibitory effect. We also tested our inhibitor in three different neutralization assays using three different cell types (HeLa, GHOST and TZM-bl) which are well established as host cells, widely used in the HIV literature. Since virus is neutralized under all these different cell culture conditions, all the cell culture ingredients will not suppress the antiviral activity of mHSA. Preincubation of cells with mHSA also had no suppressive effect, showing that mHSA is not non-specifically adsorbed by the cells or their different membrane components. Moreover, the normal growth of other viruses like yellow fever and dengue-2 virus in cell cultures, over a period of up to 9 days, containing mHSA [16] indicates that mHSA has no unspecific overall neutralizing activity or toxic activity that inhibits cellular growth and more especially viral production. We have also tested mHSA in other sensitive cell culture systems (Plasmodium falciparum growth in erythrocytes, Lassa-, Marburg-, SARS virus growth) over a time period of 14 days (data not shown). In all these cell culture experiments we observed no inhibitory effect on pathogen growth indicating that mHSA in not a cellular toxin per se.",

As was shown in animals, the active immunization of rats with Freund's adjuvant together with a high dose of chlorinated autoantigen induced an immune response against the HOCl-modified protein [27]. Induction of autoantibody might be a risk factor in the direct application of HOCl-modified proteins into body fluids but seems to be no major problem when applied as a topical microbicide. On the other hand, serum albumin is an important carrier for drugs and enzymes. In particular the transport of the enzyme MPO across the endothelial barrier depends on a specific interaction between HSA and MPO [28]. The HSA-binding epitope on MPO was identified as a short linear region (aa 425-454), causing high-affinity binding to HSA. The very close proximity of HSA and MPO implicates that HSA might be highly susceptible for MPO-dependent modifications. This also suggests that MPO-modified serum albumin is a common self antigen and therefore might be tolerated by the immune system.",

In published studies, HOCl-induced modifications were analyzed after treatment of peptides or proteins with a 0.5-25-fold molar excess of HOCl [18,29-31]. As shown by Vossmann et al. [16] as well as in the present study, an antiviral activity of serum albumins was observed only after treatment of serum albumin with HOCl concentrations above the molar ratio of 1:100. Using lower HOCl concentration, e.g. 1:10 or 1:50 we were unable to detect any antiviral activity in our HIV-1 infection assays. This observation is important and demonstrates that HOCl modifications, which occur under low HOCl conditions [18,29-31] might be totally different to those induced with higher HOCl concentrations as shown here. Another minor aspect is that we have modified albumin at concentrations \u2264 1 mg protein/ml. When serum albumin was treated with HOCl at higher concentrations, as described in the literature (10 mg/ml) [29], we observed no inhibitory activity in our viral infection and syncytium assays (data not shown). Thus, based on our current knowledge, the antiviral activity of serum albumins was induced in diluted aqueous solution and only with a >100-fold molar excess of HOCl.",

Data describing this process are available mainly based on the structure analysis of modified amino acids or peptides at low HOCl concentration. In a report by Salavej et al. [31], HSA was treated with HOCl at a 25-fold molar excess, similar to the procedure by Pattison et al. [18]. In their analysis, oxygenation was detected for Trp238, Met147, Met353, and Met572, but no chlorination of any of the HSA residues was detected. Using HOBr, Salavej and coworkers detected the incorporation of one or two bromines at Tyr425, but no chlorination of any HSA residues was detected in HOCl treated samples [31]. However, the treatment of amino acid residues with HOCl leads to the documented side chain modifications, but HOCl-modification seems not to be limited to these side chain products. In the context of a linear peptide or protein HOCl-modified side chains undergo intra- or inter-molecular cross linking. Thus, in the context of a complex protein and probably under conditions with excessive concentrations of HOCl, the process is pushed towards the development of complex protein conformations the nature of which is still unknown. One final product of HOCl-treatment seems to be the generation of stable antigenic epitopes on human serum albumin.",

However, our study supports the hypothesis that HOCl might be part of the host defense against pathogens and apart from its direct toxic activity it may have an additional indirect but important activity, the transformation of a protein into an antiviral weapon [16]. From the cell culture experiments of Chase et al. and Klebanoff et al. [11,12], in which activated PMN cells release MPO and HOCl was generated, HOCl was suggested as the HIV-1-killing agent. Based on our results it is conceivable that the generated HOCl reacts with bovine serum albumin, which is usually present in high concentrations in cell culture media, and therefore mBSA would be present during viral infection. As we have now demonstrated, mBSA has a strong antiviral activity and might be also responsible for the antiviral effects observed in PMN cell cultures. The biological relevance of HOCl-modification of serum albumin or other proteins might be questionable since virus replication in vivo is not limited to inflammatory loci, where MPO is expressed in vivo leading to the production of HOCl. To our understanding, the discovery of HOCl-modified serum albumin as an antiviral agent opens a new field for the development of non-toxic agents which can be added to blood products or can be used as a local microbicide to prevent viral transmission. Since the neutralizing activity of HOCl-modified serum albumins was documented against West Nile virus and the HIV-1 NL4-3 mutants, irrespective to their coreceptor type, future work will show how efficient HOCl-modified serum albumins can neutralize other HIV-1 and HIV-2 variants as well as other viral species.",
