Nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) were extracted (QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit) from 140 \u03bcL of clarified stool supernatant and were eluted into 60 \u03bcL of water. First-round PCR primers were AK-VP-F1 (5\u2032-CGCCGTGGCT-CCTGCTCT-3\u2032) and AK-VP-R1 (5\u2032-TGTTCGCCATCACAAA-AGATGTG-3\u2032) and second-round primers were AK-VP-F2 (5\u2032-GGCTCCTGCTCTAGGAAATAAAGAG-3\u2019) and AK-VP-R2 (5\u2018-CCTGCTGTTAGGTCGTTGTTGTATGT-3\u2032). PCR reactions contained 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (NEB) in 1.1X Thermopol reaction buffer with MgCl (2.0 mmol/L), 20 pmol/ L (each) of forward and reverse primers, and 2.5 \u03bcL of nucleic acids (first round) or 1 mL of the first-round PCR product (second round) as template in a 50 mL total volume. Firstround conditions were 10 cycles at 95oC for 35 s, 58oC for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, with a decrease of 0.5\u00b0C in annealing temperature each cycle; 30 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 54\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Similar conditions were used for the second PCR round, except that the initial annealing temperatures were 60\u00b0C and 58\u00b0C in the first and second group of PCR cycles, respectively. Amplicons of the appropriate size, as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, were directly sequenced. The PCR products whose sequences are reported here produced unambiguous dideoxysequencing electrophoregram peaks indicating the predominance (>90%) of a single bocavirus variant. The sensitivity of the pan-bocavirus nested PCR was determined using dilution of plasmids containing the target sequences from each of the 4 bocavirus species and was estimated at 10\u2013100 plasmid copies for each species.",

Nucleic acids from human stools collected from Nigeria, Tunisia, Nepal, and the United States were then analyzed using this nested PCR (Table 1). Of the 641 samples tested, 101 (16%) had confirmed positive results by PCR sequencing, with the highest prevalence in Tunisian children with AFP (33%). To determine the phylogenetic relationship of these strains, the sequences were aligned with available sequences of HBoV1, HBoV2, and HBoV3. Only 4 of 101 strains (from Nigeria and Tunisia) grouped with HBoV1. The remaining strains shared a more recent common ancestry with HBoV2, although the sequences clustered into 4 distinct genetic lineages, labeled HBoV2A, HBoV2B, HBoV3, HBoV4 (Figure 1).",

For the VP1 protein, the relative divergences were reversed, with an average divergence of 8.5% with HBoV3, 9.5% with HBoV2, and 19% with HBoV1. NI-385, therefore, also appears to be a recombinant, with the 5\u2032 genes NS1 and NP1 closely related to HBoV2 (particularly genotype A) and the 3\u2032 VP1 gene slightly more similar to HBoV3 than HBoV2 (Table 2). According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses species demarcation criteria in the genus Bocavirus,members of different species must show >5% divergence in their nonstructural gene nucleotide sequences [37]. The genetic distance of NI-385 to its closest relatives in the NS1 gene (HBoV2A) was 10.8% (range, 6.8%-12.6%), indicating that NI-385 qualifies, pending International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses review, as the prototype of a fourth HBoV species (HBoV4). A distant VP1 (partial) variant of HBoV4 was also detected in the United States (US-MN-964\u201305; Figure 1). To determine whether the latter variant represents a second HBoV4 genotype will require full genome sequencing.",

We noticed in all 4 HBoV species the presence of a stretch of encoded amino acids similar to the C-terminus of the longer NS1 of animal bocaviruses overlapping the NP ORF, but in a different frame (Figure 5A). Genomes of all HBoV species were aligned to determine the presence of conserved potential RNA splicing signals near the end of the smaller NS2 ORF and the putative second exon encoding the C-terminal region of NS1 (Figure 5B). The putative NS1 resulting from such a spliced transcript encoded a 750\u2013780 amino acid protein with a carboxy terminus that showed significant similarity to that of the canine and bovine bocaviruses NS1 (Figure 5C) [39, 40]. A study using RT-PCR for the detection of HBoV1 viral transcript in human lung epithelial cells did not detect the NS splicing proposed here [41]. On the other hand, the proposed NS1 RNA splicing and NS1 protein expression itself were detected using Northern blots and NS1 C-termini specific sera, respectively, in 293 and human epithelial cells transfected with plasmids expressing HBoV1 transcripts (Jianming Qiu, personal communication).",

The prevalence of HBoV2 in adults with diarrhea from the United States and Nepal were also compared with those in healthy matched subjects. No associations were observed between HBoV2 shedding and diarrhea. Although the numbers of HBoV3 and HBoV4 detected were relatively small, it was noticed that the 8 HBoV3-and 4 HBoV4-positive samples were found among 192 samples from patients with AFP, whereas these 2 species were not detected among 96 healthy Tunisian matched contacts.

The newly reported Australian HBoV3 (EU918736) is closely related to a Tunisian strain (TA-210\u201307) (Figure 2). A highly prevalent genotype of HBoV2 (HBoV2B), together with partial genomic support for second genotypes of HBoV3 and HBoV4, were also identified. The availability of novel bocavirus genomes will allow the design of species-specific PCR or microarray oligonucleotides for their detection and for the disease association studies that are now required for the 3 recently characterized enteric human bocavirus species (HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4). Based on the phylogenetic clustering observed for a large number of partial VP1 sequences (Figure 1) and the distances among full genomes (Table 2), we propose for future classification that HBoV strains showing >8% protein and >10% nucleotide difference in the complete VP1 gene should be considered different species, whereas those showing >1.5% protein and >5% nucleotide difference should be considered different genotypes. This VP1-based classification retains the 4 proposed human bocavirus species. The VP1 locus was selected because it is likely to strongly influence tissue tropism and potentially pathogenesis [42].",

In contrast, this single study found substantial diversity among HBoV2 and HBoV3, a fourth species (HBoV4), and extensive viral recombination (Figures 3, 4B,and 4C). Assuming comparable rates of evolution, the genetically homogeneous and largely respiratory HBoV1, therefore, appears to be the more recently evolved species relative to the more diverse HBoV2, 3, and 4 found predominantly in feces. We propose that HBoV1 evolved from an enteric bocavirus ancestor that acquired, through mutation and/or recombination, enhanced respiratory tract tropism. Single-stranded DNA parvoviruses have been shown to have a mutation rate approaching that of RNA viruses, and recombination among animal parvoviruses has also been reported [45\u201347]. Parvoviruses have also demonstrated the capacity to rapidly expand their host species tropism, resulting in a recent pandemic in dogs [42, 48, 49]. A recent study showed that HBoV1 could replicate in differentiated human airway epithelial cells [41]. Whether HBoV2, 3, and 4 show an in vitro tropism and in vivo distribution that is more biased towards digestive track cells will require further study.",
