Most commonly it presents with cough, which is difficult to differentiate from the ubiquitous cough that may occurs as a common side-effect of combination treatment.

This paper aims to review the salient issues of pneumonitis in the setting of HCV combination treatment and aims to offer guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonitis.",

He had been using intravenous (i.v.) drugs until 1985 and his medical history revealed multiple total hip replacements and revisions because of hip necrosis attributed to i.v. drug-related blood-borne infections. Liver function tests were abnormal: alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) 237 IU/L (normal <45 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) 235 IU/L (normal <50 IU/L), \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase 241 IU/L (normal <55 IU/L), and bilirubin 19 \u03bcmol/L (normal <10 \u03bcmol/L). The patient was infected with genotype 3 HCV virus with high viral load (>5 \u00d7 105 IU/ml). A liver biopsy was performed and showed moderate necroinflammation with portoportal fibrosis (METAVIR; grade A2, score F2). In view of this advanced stage we offered the patient a 24-week treatment for HCV consisting of peginterferon \u03b1-2b (Pegintron\u00ae; 150 \u03bcg s.c. weekly) in combination with ribavirin (Rebetol\u00ae; 400 mg twice daily).",

Although dry, nonproductive cough is usually caused by ribavirin, it typically clears after stopping the drug. The dry cough, however, persisted after end of treatment, being the reason to consult a chest physician. Physical examination revealed bibasal crepitations. A new chest radiograph showed bilaterally a diffuse, interstitial pattern (Fig. 1a) and chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities in central and upper zones (Fig. 1b). Pulmonary function tests indicated a restriction and a diminished diffusing capacity. Maximal incremental cycle ergometry showed decreased breathing reserve (0 l/min), high breathing frequency (65/min), and exercise-induced hypoxemia caused by an oxygen uptake problem, compatible with interstitial pulmonary disease. Results from bronchoalveolar lavage supported a diagnosis of drug-induced interstitial pneumonitis (cell count 1.68 \u00d7 109/L, 73% lymphocytes, CD4/CD8 ratio 0.5). The results of cultures and stains of the bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were negative for bacteria, fungi, acid-fast bacteria, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and malignant cells. There were no signs of infection (blood culture was negative).\n",

We included the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center (www.lareb.nl) database and the Drug-Induced Lung Diseases database (www.pneumotox.com), and lastly we performed an exhaustive search of the database of the World Health Organization (WHO) via the Uppsala monitoring center (http://www.who-umc.org).
