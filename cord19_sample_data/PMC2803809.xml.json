The principal treatment for patients with this syndrome includes etoposide 150 mg/2 M twice a week for two weeks, dexamethasone 10 mg/2 M for two weeks and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg for a longer period of time. Relapsing cases of MAS are relatively rare. However, there are several case reports that describe a relapse happening after a short treatment or after the dose of cyclosporine was decreased rapidly [1].",

These high levels most probably reflect an acute phase response, since hepatocytes responding to inflammatory cytokines increase ferritin synthesis [5]. Since ferritin levels are not that high in other rheumatologic diseases, it was suggested as a candidate for a serologic marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of the response to treatment of SD. However, other studies suggest that the portion of glycosylated ferritin (less than 20% of the total value of ferritin) is a more specific finding for the diagnosis of SD, in contrast to other rheumatologic diseases where the value is much higher [6]. Interleukin-6, TNF alpha, interferon gamma and interleukin 18 may be elevated during the active phase of the disease, but serology for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor are negative [7].",

Hypofibrinogenemia is one of the most important clues for the diagnosis of MAS since patients usually have high fibrinogen levels due to their underlying inflammatory disease. An increased fibrinolysis is most probably due to uncontrolled activation of the macrophages and the production of plasminogen. A decrease in factor II and factor VII + X values is also observed in some reported cases [13]. A bone marrow smear may show macrophage hemophagocytosis. Another biological indicator of MAS is an increased level of serum triglyceride that can be related to the patient's extensive production of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, which reduce the lipoprotein lipase activity. Interleukin-1 and interferon gamma are also overproduced in a patient with MAS [1].",

In resistant cases, several modes of therapy were described including high dose steroids, cyclosporine, antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG), intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), plasma exchange and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [14]. Recently, IL-1 beta receptor antagonist (Anakinra) was used with success in severe cases of HLH [15].",
