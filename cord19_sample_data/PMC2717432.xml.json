Approximately 100,000 infants are annually admitted with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in the USA, and the number of hospitalizations is increasing [2]. Because of this, RSV-associated disease imposes a major burden on health care resources [3]. There is no effective therapy against RSV available, prevention can only be achieved through passive immunisation using monoclonal antibodies [4]. RSV LRTD is pathophysiologically characterized by sloughed necrotic epithelium, excessive mucus secretion, bronchial mucosal oedema and peribronchial inflammation that contributes to airway obstruction resulting in increased airway resistance with subsequent air-trapping and respiratory acidosis [5,6]. Although the majority of infections run a mild disease course, mechanical ventilation (MV) for up to 10 days is necessitated in approximately 2% to 16% of previously healthy hospitalised infants due to severe lower respiratory tract infection including bronchiolitis or pneumonia [1,7,8].",

With helium, a more laminar flow is preserved in narrowed airways, resulting in lower resistance to gas flow allowing for increased bulk flow [10]. Based on these properties, MV with heliox could be considered in mechanically ventilated infants with RSV LRTD. Its use in these patients has been studied once but with inconclusive results [11].",

The objective of our study was to test this hypothesis in a prospective, double cross-over intervention trial comparing heliox 60/40 with conventional gas (nitrox) using lung function testing and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measurements.",

A 30 second reference measurement at 13 Hz scan rate was recorded. All further measurements were referenced to this measurement. All other measurements were made at a scan rate of 44 Hz for 180 seconds. A 5 mA peak-to-peak, 50 kHz electrical current was injected at each adjacent electrode pair, and the resultant potential differences were measured at the remaining adjacent electrode pairs. Subsequently, all adjacent electrode pairs were used for current injection, thus completing one data cycle. The impedance map was built using the back-projection image reconstruction algorithm [13].

            "text": "The decrease in Rrs led not to an improved CO2 clearance as defined by the VI or a reduction in PEFR. Some explanations for this may be proposed. First, it is uncertain how much of the observed reduction in Rrs could be partitioned to the ventilator circuit or the endotracheal tube because no endotracheal suctioning was performed during the study. Increased mucus production during RSV LRTD is common, and may further obstruct the airways [26]. As the AVEA ventilator is able to calculate the Rlung, we also studied if MV with heliox resulted in a reduction in Rlung, but were unable to demonstrate this. This could mean that MV with heliox does not affect the resistance of the small airways of the infants; it cannot be ruled out, however, that the resolution of the AVEA's signal of Rlung (1 decimal) might not be sufficient enough to detect true differences in Rlung in small children with little tidal volume. Second, the measured Rrs in our patients is lower than previously reported in mechanically ventilated infants with RSV LRTD designated to have an obstructive disease phenotype [20,22,27]. This could indicate that our patients had mild-to-moderate airway obstruction, although hyperinflation suggesting airway obstruction on chest radiograph was present in all but one patient. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for the radiological definition of hyperinflation especially in mechanically ventilated infants. Furthermore, the degree of air-trapping might vary between patients, indicating that severe RSV LRTD necessitating MV is a heterogeneous disease in which patients express to a varying degree both restrictive and obstructive disease characteristics explaining why some patients had a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200 or a Cstat less than 0.3 ml/cmH2O/kg in our study. This assumption opposes the previously proposed dichotomization of RSV LRTD by Hammer and colleagues, who have observed that mechanically ventilated infants with RSV LRTD showed either a disease pattern compatible with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a disease pattern characterized by increased airway resistance [27]. Although our study was not designed to investigate differences in clinical phenotype, we would dare to challenge this dichotomy in clinical phenotype for several reasons. Hammer and colleagues included prematurely born infants with chronic lung disease and infants with congenital heart disease [27]. Crs is significantly lower in these patients compared with healthy infants [28-30]. In addition, the term 'bronchiolitis' to describe RSV LRTD is strictly speaking a histopathologic diagnosis and hampered by universal differences in its clinical interpretation [31]. Controversy exists about whether differences in parameters for gas exchange correlate with clinical phenotype [32,33].",

            "text": "EIT is a non-invasive bedside technique to assess global and regional lung volumes that has primarily been used in acute lung injury or ARDS [35]. Hinz and colleagues have shown that compared with the validated nitrogen-washout method it is an appropriate tool to study EELV in critically ill patients [16]. To our knowledge, the use of EIT in the determination of the dynamic process of air-trapping in patients with small airway disease has not been used before, although its use in this disease condition can be rationalised. In our study, MV with heliox did not result in a universal reduction of air-trapping as defined by the relative \u0394EELV. However, there were some patients who seemed to benefit from MV with heliox as they did show a reduction in relative \u0394EELV that was reversed by MV with conventional gas. Several explanations for the non-universal reduction in relative \u0394EELV may be proposed. First, not all alveoli have the same degree of hyperinflation due to the difference in time constants throughout the lung, indicating that hyperinflation is a regional phenomenon rather than a global problem [36]. This would implicate that the technique of EIT may be insufficient to detect regional differences in viral-induced small airway disease due to heterogeneity of the disease, a problem that can be overcome by increasing the resolution of the EIT signal. In favor of EIT, however, is the study by Adler and colleagues showing that with EIT dynamic hyperinflation could be adequately monitored [37]. Second, during the study no endotracheal suctioning was performed. Increased mucus production could obstruct the airways, resulting in the collapse of alveoli that is reflected by a decrease in EELV. As tidal volume remained constant throughout the experiment, we think that not performing endotracheal suctioning did not influence our results (Figure 5). Third, if there is a difference in expression of clinical phenotype of RSV LRTD a universal response in relative \u0394EELV would not be expected. Some patients responded with a decrease in relative \u0394EELV whereas others did not in our study. Also, redistribution of ventilation within each lung or between the left and right lung was not significantly influenced by MV with heliox. This is in line with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype of RSV LRTD.",

This sample size does not allow discrimination between responders and non-responders nor a categorization of clinical phenotype based on chest radiographs, but this should be the subject of further research. Second, patients were paralyzed throughout the study, thus prohibiting spontaneous breathing and mucus clearance by the patient itself. We choose to do so to eliminate any confounding effect of spontaneous breathing on the degree of dynamic hyperinflation in order to truly assess the effect of MV with heliox. However, our findings require re-evaluation in spontaneously breathing mechanically ventilated infants. Supportive therapy maintaining spontaneous breathing could very well be a key element while awaiting therapeutic modalities for mechanically ventilated infants with RSV LRTD [38]. Third, the measurements of our study were not blinded because connection of the heliox and the measurements were conducted by one investigator (MK). However, this might have introduced measurement bias. Fourth, ventilation with heliox may have influenced the tidal volume measurements of the AVEA ventilator. The AVEA is equipped with the Bicore CP100\u2122 pulmonary mechanics monitor that has been validated previously [36,39]. Finally, the AVEA performs in a similar way with respect to tidal volume measurement when heliox is used [40,41].",
