            "text": "The incidence and frequency of epidemic transmission of zoonotic diseases, both known and newly recognized, has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. It is thought that this dramatic disease emergence is primarily the result of the social, demographic, and environmental transformation that has occurred globally since World War II. However, the causal linkages have not been elucidated. Investigating emerging zoonotic pathogens as an ecological phenomenon can provide significant insights as to why some of these pathogens have jumped species and caused major epidemics in humans. A review of concepts and theory from biological ecology and of causal factors in disease emergence previously described suggests a general model of global zoonotic disease emergence. The model links demographic and societal factors to land use and land cover change whose associated ecological factors help explain disease emergence. The scale and magnitude of these changes are more significant than those associated with climate change, the effects of which are largely not yet understood. Unfortunately, the complex character and non-linear behavior of the human-natural systems in which host-pathogen systems are embedded makes specific incidences of disease emergence or epidemics inherently difficult to predict. Employing a complex systems analytical approach, however, may show how a few key ecological variables and system properties, including the adaptive capacity of institutions, explains the emergence of infectious diseases and how an integrated, multi-level approach to zoonotic disease control can reduce risk.",

Not only does this new area address the dynamic behavior of complex, large scale systems, but also bridges theory from the traditionally separate biological and social science disciplines, thus contributing to the interdisciplinary research agenda also called for in the above reports. The purpose of this paper is to consider how regional and global zoonotic disease emergence trends might be explained on the basis of current thought in biological ecology including the very recent developments new to the field of infectious disease ecology. Here we draw on ecological science as broadly defined as a basis for identifying causal mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence, the ultimate goal being to enhance disease prevention and control programs.",

Most recently, the Institute of Medicine (1) described these along with others (13 categories of factors in all) and a model stating the major categories of factors have historically converged to bring about the current global emerging infectious disease crisis. Ecological factors are described as one of four major categories of factors that have converged with social, political, and economic factors; genetic and biological factors; and physical environmental factors. We take a different approach to understanding the interaction of the above factors and their causal relationships by focusing on disease emergence as an ecological-evolutionary phenomenon influenced by human factors. Our interest is in how human factors interact with natural processes and, in particular, how mechanisms operating at levels meaningful to understanding pathogen transmission and evolution can result in regional and ultimately global phenomena (i.e., regional endemism, epidemics, or global pandemics).",

            "text": "As a first step we distinguish between the two broad categories of human factors, 'demographic and societal' and 'disease intervention and policy' suggested previously by Gubler (10) ( Table 1) . This categorization differentiates between factors associated with specific kinds of environments or ecosystems and those involving biological and policy factors not so associated. However, both can be described as part of a single ecological framework involving interaction of systems of essentially natural versus human design, respectively. Our focus is on the first category from the standpoint of how disease emergence is explained by ecological concepts and principles. This includes some relatively new models and theory not previously used to explain the current trend in increasing emerging infectious diseases. We present a general model of zoonotic disease emergence on this basis. We also discuss recent explanations based on complexity theory for how human behavior and ecosystems interact to contribute to disease emergence. Classical ecology, or natural history, has been the basis and mainstay of infectious disease research since its origins with 'Koch's Postulates' and subsequent development of microbiology and zoonotic disease epidemiology during the 19th and 20th Centuries (14, 15) . Throughout much of its early history, zoonotic disease research involved this descriptive, empiricallybased ecology: identifying the life cycle, transmission, incidental and natural hosts of pathogens, along with demographic, life history, dispersal, and habitat attributes of reservoirs and vectors. A substantial theoretical dimension has developed, beginning with Ross's mathematical analysis of malaria transmission (16) and extending to Anderson and May's (17) recent synthesis Infectious Diseases of Humans.",

Fortunately, theoretical disease ecology, stimulated largely by the work of Anderson, May and others has flourished and led to a significant syntheses involving application of ecological-evolutionary biology to the study of infectious diseases (19, 20) . Parallel to this, systems ecology has begun to extend its domain by applying complexity theory to emerging infections with at least initial suggestions of its implications (6) . This development in particular, along with observations from several decades of applications of systems ecology to natural resources and economic development (8, (21) (22) (23) , have resulted in important insights of significant potential in understanding zoonotic disease emergence as a cross-scale process. This area uses complex systems theory applied to coupled, human-natural systems to explain how processes such as local phenomena can result in a cascade of effects ultimately reaching global proportions. The finding suggests this crossscale behavior is controlled by relatively few variables, and is mitigated by social and ecological resilience. The loss of this resilience in ecological systems is observed to lead inevitably to unpredictable events or the 'surprise' characteristic of complex systems generally. This combination of socialecological systems and resilience theory helps explain the unpredictability of disease emergence events. It represents another potentially useful area of application to understanding emerging infectious diseases along with those areas generally considered within the domain of ecology mentioned above: population ecology and genetics, community ecology, and systems ecology.",

The accumulated findings demonstrate thresholds exist, depending on the type of pathogen and host population, below which a pathogen cannot be sustained. Considered in light of the exponentially increasing size of human and domestic host and vector populations in the world, the breaching of thresholds of pathogen persistence can explain much of the increase in emerging infectious diseases.",

Although zoonotic disease emergence is not entirely a tropical phenomenon, it is mostly associated with tropical developing regions undergoing the most rapid population growth and ecological changes. Prior to the post-WWII economic era, most regional ecosystems in the tropics consisted of relatively scattered human settlements, and only a few large cities (>500,000) (24) . These were separated by large expanses of cropland and pastureland and relatively undisturbed forest. Since then, in what has been the most rapid period of large scale ecological transformation in human history, the pattern has essentially reversed (25) . The once scattered settlements and few large cities have coalesced into expansive megacities and surrounding periurban settlements with only remnant patches of undisturbed forest remaining in a sea of cropland, scrub, and ecologically degraded lands. Dacca, Bangladesh, which grew from a population size of 200,000 to 13 million from 1970 to 2003, is one of many examples.",

This explains the abrupt transitions of urban diseases between non-persistence to endemic and endemic to epidemic behavior as population densities of susceptible humans, hosts, and vectors reach critical densities. The classic illustration is that of measles which, given its particular transmission rate, requires human settlements with population sizes in excess (>250,000) of what historically existed in most pre-industrial states and geographically isolated populations even today (28). Thus, for example, many infectious diseases endemic on continents have not become established on islands despite their occasional introduction and the occurrence of local outbreaks. The same mathematical ecology that explains why measles and virtually all diseases have threshold densities, explains the much lower thresholds existing for vector-borne diseases such as arboviruses (29) . Particularly noteworthy is the theoretical demonstration that the pathogen 'reproductive rate' increases with the square of vector population density. This indicates threshold densities can fast be breached as domestic and peridomestic hosts and vectors expand (or re-expand) their geographic ranges (once they are introduced or re-introduced) and increase their densities. This helps explain the explosive re-emergence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever in the American Tropics as vector populations responded to relaxed controls and new breeding habitats associated with urbanization (30) . This phenomenon can be likened to the gradual build-up of 'dead and down' wood across a forested landscape with a history of fire suppression. The build-up of fuel, like that of host or vector populations, becomes an 'accident waiting to happen' when a single ignition event in one locality, similar to a single infection event, spreads to the entire region.",

The probability of producing more virulent variants not only increases with host population size but also with crowding and co-mingling of different host species (31) .

There are a number of implications to zoonotic disease emergence, although most have not yet been described in terms of disease emergence or in the medical, public health, or zoonotic disease literature. Of critical significance from this area of ecology is the general principle of community assembly. Research has demonstrated that communities of arranged predicably in terms of 'assembly rules' (34) . This order, in terms of the spatial distribution, composition and the abundance of each species in an ecological community, is affected by interspecific interactions (predation, competition, and parasitism). Density independent factors (e.g., weather, natural catastrophes) play an important, but a more ephemeral role in most ecosystems. The process of community assembly (and disassembly) has been particularly well demonstrated through studies of insular ecosystems, the so-called 'species area relationship,' and the phenomenon of faunal collapse (35) (36) (37) . A principal outcome and the ecological significance of this body of research first described in terms of the process of 'habitat fragmentation', has been identified as the principal mechanism by which human land and resource use contributes to species extinction (38) . Although initially debated, a significant amount of evidence has since accumulated resulting in its general acceptance and applicability, particularly to tropical forest ecosystems (36, 39, 40) .",

Broad spectrum pesticide use and habitat simplification, along with habitat fragmentation, are important contributing factors. The reduction in species diversity can contribute to the phenomenon of 'ecological release' in remaining species, whose predators, competitor and parasites are reduced in numbers or eliminated. Some of these may be already serving as zoonotic reservoirs or vectors. If so, ecological release may result in their proliferation. This helps explain why many emerging zoonotic diseases occur in areas where settlement and agricultural expansion recently have encroached into tropical forests. A similar phenomenon, associated with the regrowth of forests in developed regions, can lead to zoonotic disease emergence. The pattern of reforestation in Eastern North America during the past half-century resulted in increased habitat favored by forest edge adapted species such as whitetail deer and white-footed mice. White-tailed deer, the principle host of the adult tick Ixodes scapulari, reinvaded the area and with few predators and competitors the population exploded. This pattern of ecological change arguably has been a major factor in the emergence of Lyme disease in this region.",

This can occur through the use of non-selective pesticides through changes in land use and land cover that affect the distribution and abundance of species. It should be noted that the disassembly of natural ecological communities that results from habitat fragmentation is a protracted process compared to exponential decay. Depending on the extent of habitat loss and other factors such as the sizes, shapes and spatial relationships of remaining fragments, the process may require decades, centuries or longer as communities 'relax' toward a new equilibrium (36, 43, 44) . It follows that the frequency of disease emergence can be expected to follow a similar path: highest rates at first, followed by gradual decline as an ecosystem 'stabilizes'.",

Regional environmental change such as that associated with population growth development often does not accommodate the need to maintain resilience (21) . Such ecosystems have been described as 'over-connected' or 'brittle' and, as stated above, 'accidents waiting to happen' (8, 22) . Floods, often associated with waterborne disease outbreaks, occur more frequently and with greater severity as a result of lost resilience in natural systems due to attempts to 'control' (in contrast to manage) natural variation. Conversion of upland forests to plantations or cropping systems for more 'efficient' natural resource production is another, as is agriculture generally. Both result in a reduction of heterogeneity in ecosystems that tend to 'buffer' against disease outbreaks, which can spread more readily across the more uniform landscape including immunologically vulnerable domesticated species. Gunderson et al. (8, 23) describe this as general pattern of institutional behavior. It begins with the targeting of a natural variable for control, followed by increasing institutional efficiency and inflexibility in the control methods used. As the target variable and ecosystem changes and initial signs of failure are ignored, the ultimate result is a crisis. This 'pathology of regional resource and ecosystem management' and is apparently applicable to infectious disease management as well.",

This schema is constructed using the generally adopted view of human-environment interaction in which the impact of human population and technology is taken as the driving force, or ultimate cause. Clark et al. (25) elaborate on this in their seminal treatment on global and regional change. Here, the combination of population, technological capacity, and sociocultural organization act as the system drivers of regional environmental change. These and 'mitigating' forces are in turn influenced by 'human behavior', referring to patterns of actions and the rationales giving rise to them. Broadly speaking, these forces and their affects on ecosystems represent the 'ecological factors' in social-ecological systems, while human behavior represents the 'social factors' for the purposes of discussion.",

The likelihood or frequency of transmission events change when the natural host or pathogen changes, humans change, or the ecosystem supporting both changes. Thus, fundamentally the processes influencing transmission of zoonotic pathogens can be described as a consequence of one or a combination of three possible kinds of change: expansion of the habitat or geographic range of a host, of a pathogen or both; expansion of human's habitat or geographic range; or change in the habitat or ecosystem occupied by both humans and the natural host. Evolutionary adaptation of pathogens is omitted from the figure. However, it can be assumed any factor contributing to increased likelihood of transmission, as well as increased population size of hosts and pathogens will contribute to the potential that new, increasingly pathogenic, infectious, antimicrobial resistant variants will emerge.

The resurgence of vector populations, having acquired pesticide resistance and lost predators and competitors as natural controls after a regimen of inappropriate pesticide use, similarly is explained by modern ecology and evolutionary biology.

For example, it points to the need to adopt control strategies that integrate landscape and habitat management with careful rotation of targeted chemical and biological agents (30) .

The 'ecological' changes taking place as a result of public health agencies' actions (or inaction) involve pathogen biology and are small scale in time and space: selection for vector pesticide and antimicrobial resistance. However, the cumulative effect of micro-scale processes involving pathogen adaptation and host range expansion (or re-expanding) can ultimately produce regional and even global consequences. However, policy action and inaction outside the domain of biomedical or public health agencies has produced ecological changes at a historically unprecedented rate and scale. Urbanization, agricultural and food production intensification, alteration of natural habitat, along with concomitant loss of ecosystem functions, have transformed entire regional ecosystems during the past 50 years. The role of urbanization cannot be underestimated. The direct land use changes associated with urbanization effectively concentrate human, animal reservoir and vector populations at unprecedented densities. But urbanization also is strongly tied to socio-economic and cultural factors, along with human migration dynamics, affecting agricultural and food production intensification, as well as rural and natural ecosystems. In the case of food production and distribution, dramatically increased contact with and transport of wildlife (e.g., bush meat trade in Africa), and increased ruralurban transport and concentration of wild species for the exotic food market (e.g., civet cats in Guangdong, China), is another contributor to increasing disease emergence. It can be assumed these impacts on wildlife populations also contribute to changes in the composition of ecological communities on a regional scale (52) , and often result in a hyper-abundance of small mammal species low in the food chain, which are likely to serve as human disease reservoirs. Similar effects of ecological disruption appear to generally apply to invertebrate commu- Whether a disease 'jumps' to the regional population and the global human population scale is determined by quite different processes. These depend on demographic and transport patterns related to processes, like urbanization, influencing pathogen transmission and behavior operating on the regional and global scales. Physical environmental processes such as climate variability (on the right side of the figure), which are episodic by nature, include short term and small scale variations in the form of seasonal storms (e.g., monsoons), for example, as well as larger time and space scale variations. These include, for example, decadal and regional scale changes in weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o. These climate changes and weather events can precipitate floods and droughts. These act as cross-scale mediators that directly affect disease reservoir and vector populations, or pathogens (e.g, dispersal via flood waters). They cause the disease to jump from a smaller demographic unit to a larger one (e.g., from a single village to a district). Human Factors such as land use and land cover changes (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ) produce ecosystem changes contributing or magnifying the cross-scale processes. For example, urbanization and deforestation increase the magnitude of floods and droughts resulting from natural or anthropogenic climate variation. nities (53) , the kinds of organisms most commonly serving as human disease vectors. The estimated acceleration of natural species extinction rates by orders of magnitude over nonanthropogenic extinction rates (54) gives an indication of the scale and magnitude of change in natural communities, particularly in the tropics.

Greater investment in research has succeeded in revealing more detail about diseases within specific disciplines. Yet this arguably has been at the cost of greater disintegration rather than integration among disciplines. The division is widest between the genetic and biological aspects of disease and health on the one hand and the social, economic, political, and physical environmental factors on the other. The disciplinary distinctions within infectious disease research of course belie the true transdisciplinary nature of this and most problems in the global heath and environment arena (59). The above disciplinary divisions largely reflect the gap between disciplines focusing on systems at or below and above the level of the organism or species. The former involve disciplines addressing the genetics, pathogenesis, or immune response within particular organisms (humans, vectors of pathogens), for example, or disease as a statistical phenomena at the species population level (the mainstay of epidemiology). The latter deal with social or ecological phenomena, essentially representing higher levels of biological organization, within which the organism-level processes operate but that also involve many other variables or processes operating on a wide range of biological scales (from genes to the biosphere) characterized by cross-scale influences, and interactions at multiple societal and ecological levels.",

The boxes illustrate the hierarchically-scaled structure of human population, in which demographic units (individual, family, town, etc.) form a nested hierarchy. These units exhibit characteristic behaviors and dynamics occurring in distinct time and space scales, beginning with the infection of one person.",
