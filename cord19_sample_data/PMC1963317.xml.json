Additional and unprecedented opportunities for zoonoses occur when live cells, tissues or organs are transplanted from one species to another [6].

However, pig to human virus transmission has been a concern since it was shown that porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) could infect human cells in culture [6], [11]\u2013[13]. Although PERV transmission has yet to be documented in xenotransplantation patients, significant concerns still exist regarding PERV and other potentially pathogenic viruses [14], [15]. Strategies to reduce the likelihood of PERV transmission have been proposed, such as selective breeding for lower levels of PERV, RNAi transgenesis to knock-down PERV expression or systematic deletion of active PERV copies (e.g., [15], [16]). The first two are unlikely to be completely effective or risk-free and the third, albeit theoretically feasible, may be overly technical and prohibitively expensive. Therefore, alternative, robust and cost-effective methods to reduce PERV transmission and possible xenozoonotic infections are desirable.",

            "text": "APOBEC3G is a single-strand DNA cytosine deaminase best understood as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication [17]\u2013[23]. It can however also inhibit a variety of other exogenous and endogenous retroviruses/elements (e.g., [17], [18], [24]\u2013[29]). APOBEC3G engages an assembling retrovirus particle, accesses the RNA genome-containing virus core and, upon reverse transcription, deaminates cDNA cytosines to uracils (C-to-U). Catastrophic levels of uracil either directly inactivate the coding capacity of the virus or trigger the degradation of the viral DNA. The former manifests as genomic strand-specific guanine to adenine (G-to-A) hypermutations (cDNA strand C-to-T transitions). However, in several instances, it is noteworthy that the deaminase activity of APOBEC3G or other APOBEC3 proteins is partly or even completely dispensable (e.g., HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, L1 and Alu [27]\u2013[32]).",

For instance, human APOBEC3G can potently inhibit the replication of SIV (except isolates such as SIVcpz which encode a Vif protein closely related to that of HIV-1), feline foamy virus and MLV (e.g., [17]\u2013[20], [25], [26], [39], [41], [42]). Similarly, mouse APOBEC3 can potently block HIV-1 replication (regardless of Vif), although it is completely unable to impede the replication of MLV [26], [41]. One of the most dramatic examples to date used human and mouse APOBEC3 proteins to inhibit the mobilization of the yeast retrotransposons Ty1 and Ty2 [43], [44]. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that cross-species expression of an APOBEC3 protein may be used to create a powerful barrier to impede or perhaps even block retrovirus infection. Here, this rationale is applied to the specific question of whether human APOBEC3G expression can inhibit the transmission of PERV from pig to human cells. The results demonstrate that PERV transmission can be strongly inhibited by APOBEC3G.",

These two cell types were used because transmission from PK-15 to 293 cells had been reported previously [11]. The trans-well system enabled co-cultures to be sustained for several weeks, and it facilitated the recovery of each cell type for downstream analyses. An additional benefit of this co-culture system (not provided by transient assays) is that it enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple, endogenous PERV elements, which are precisely the targets one would want to monitor and ideally inhibit in (xeno)transplantation procedures.",

From the point of first detection onward, the total number of PERV transmissions continued to increase, averaging 190 new events per day per 50,000 cells (105\nbeta-actin copies; SEM = 62; n = 5 experiments). Importantly, pig cells did not breach the 293T cell compartment because Q-PCR analyses of the same human genomic DNA samples failed to detect a concomitant transfer of pig genomic DNA (Figure 1B; also see Online Figure S1 for PERV pol gene Q-PCR standard curves, representative PERV-specific datasets and human beta-actin controls). Moreover, PERV copy number did not increase over a two week interval when infected 293T cells were grown in isolation, indicating that PERV was not replicating in the human cells and that the majority of the observed transmission events were derived from the PK-15 cells (i.e., new events).

The kinetics of PERV transmission were similar to those reported in Figure 1B (these results also contributed to the aforementioned transfer rate calculations).

Expression of human APOBEC3G in a heterologous system has been shown to trigger elevated levels of genomic C/G-to-T/A transition mutation [44]. Therefore, to help mitigate this risk (in addition to establishing clones that expressed relatively modest APOBEC3G levels; above), we asked whether the predominantly cytoplasmic localization pattern of human APOBEC3G would be maintained in PK-15 and in a swine testes cell line, ST-IOWA (Figure 3; compare with other APOBEC3G reports [18], [35], [41]). Unlike some other APOBEC3 proteins such as human APOBEC3B, which is mostly nuclear, both human APOBEC3G and pig APOBEC3F appeared predominantly cytoplasmic in either the human or the pig cell lines (Figure 3; [28], [31], [41]). Both proteins also appeared to concentrate in cytoplasmic punctae, which varied in number and were apparent in some of the cells regardless of species of origin (described previously for APOBEC3G; e.g., [45], [46]). Overall, these near-identical localization patterns suggested that human APOBEC3G is not aberrantly regulated in pig cells and, interestingly, that these proteins might be subjected to the same cellular regulatory mechanism(s).",

Therefore, we wondered whether pig APOBEC3F was expressed in PK-15 and, if so, whether PERV resists this cellular defense. To begin to address this possibility, RT-PCR was used to test PK-15 cells for pig APOBEC3F expression. Pig APOBEC3F mRNA was detected readily (Online Figure S3A). Full cDNA sequencing revealed that the predicted APOBEC3F protein of PK-15 cells was 98% identical to the variant we reported previously [41]. Eight amino acid differences were found, but both the PK15 and the previously reported APOBEC3F sequences were represented in pig genomic DNA sequences suggesting that these may be breed-specific polymorphisms (R.S.L. and R.S.H., manuscript in preparation). These observations indicated that either PERV resists the endogenous APOBEC3F protein of its host or that the level of suppression by pig APOBEC3F is not sufficient to inhibit PERV transmission.",

Taking this together with the observation that APOBEC3G does not effect PK-15 virus production (similar RT levels were observed in cell-free supernatants in the presence or absence of APOBEC3G; data not shown), we infer that APOBEC3G restricts PERV transmission after virus production but before provirus integration (i.e., between entry and integration). APOBEC3G may restrict PERV at an early reverse transcription stage, possibly by interfering with primer binding, DNA synthesis and/or integration as shown recently for APOBEC3G and HIV-1 substrates (e.g., [30], [52]\u2013[55]).",

In contrast, the rare PERV sequences derived from the APOBEC3G co-culture experiments showed a much lower genetic complexity. Only three unique sequences were recovered, each differing by a single nucleotide (Online Figure S4). In parallel experiments with HIV-based viruses, this APOBEC3G expression construct caused approximately 30 G-to-A hypermutations per 1000 bases analyzed (e.g., [41]). Thus, approximately 12 G-to-A transitions should have been recovered in these PERV DNA analyses (nearly 90 if multiply recovered sequences would have been considered). The absence of hypermutated PERV proviral DNA provided further support for a deaminase-independent mechanism of restriction, which may share features with other instances described previously (e.g., [27]\u2013[30]).",

The deamination-independence of the restriction mechanism suggests that a catalytically inert APOBEC3G protein, such as E259Q, may be equally potent and simultaneously reduce the risk of cancer-promoting mutagenesis. APOBEC3G or APOBEC3G-E295Q expressing pigs may therefore constitute safer source animals for pig-to-human xenotransplantation procedures. In contrast to knockdown, knockout (by gene targeting or selective breeding) or most chemical-based anti-viral approaches to neutralize PERV [15], the APOBEC3 anti-viral defense system has several advantages including a potentially broad neutralizing activity (effective against PERV and likely several other endogenous and exogenous viruses) and an applicability to situations where many copies of a virus are already present in a genome. Analogous transgenic applications can be envisaged, such as using cross-species APOBEC3 expression to purposefully impede known viruses (e.g., the AIDS virus HIV-1 or the Hepatitis B virus HBV). Moreover, for humans and other mammals with multiple APOBEC3 proteins, our data encourage the development of methods to induce/up-regulate endogenous APOBEC3 proteins, which have the capacity but may not normally restrict a particular virus (e.g., human APOBEC3B and HIV-1).",

The primer sets used in this study were: PERV pol (193 bp): 5\u2032-AAC CCT TTA CCC TTT ATG TGG AT and 5\u2032-AAA GTC AAT TTG TCA GCG TCC TT; human beta-actin (133 bp)[57]: 5\u2032-ATC ATG TTT GAG ACC TTC AA and 5\u2032-AGA TGG GCA CAG TGT GGG T; pig genomic DNA (341 bp product specific to intron 5 of the pig APOBEC3F locus): 5\u2032-TGG GGA GTG TGG AAT TAA CG and 5\u2032-GGG GGT TAA GAA CCC AAC AT.",
