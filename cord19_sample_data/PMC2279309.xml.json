Analysis of the curve in the low q region with the Guinier approximation gave an Rg of 32.7 \u00b1 0.7 \u00c5. The molecular mass (MM) calculated from the forward scattering intensity I(0) is 23.5 \u00b1 2 kDa, in agreement with the value expected for a 1:1 stoichiometric complex (21.3 kDa), thus suggesting that the complex did form in solution. The high value of Rg indicated that the overall structure of the NTAILHN\u2013XD complex is not compact. The distances distribution function inferred from the scattering curve of the NTAILHN\u2013XD complex exhibits a maximum at 20 \u00c5, with a shoulder at about 30 \u00c5 and a long tail up to 146 \u00c5, typical of an elongated object (see Fig. 2A \u25b6).

            "text": "The overall envelope of the complex was restored ab initio from its scattering profile using the program GASBOR (Svergun et al. 2001). Several independent runs yielded different shapes with recurrent features: they were all elongated, with a globular cluster of always the same size at one extremity and an elongated protuberance with varying bends and cross-sections. The quality of the fit to the experimental data was similar in all cases, with a \u03c72 of 1.3 to 1.6. The globular part most probably corresponds to XD packed against the folded region of NTAIL, while the outgrowth corresponds to unfolded regions of the latter. The crystal structure of the XD\u2013NTAIL486\u2013505 complex (PDB code 1T6O), which encompasses the \u03b1-MoRE (residues 488\u2013 499), was inserted in the shape using the program SUPCOMB (Kozin and Svergun 2001) (Fig. 2B \u25b6). Interestingly, only one protuberance was observed, corresponding to the N-terminal area of NTAIL, and no other protuberance was restored from the shape determination in the opposite region of the globular cluster, thus suggesting that the C-terminal region of NTAIL (aa 506\u2013525), although not visible per se, is packed inside the bulky portion of the complex (Fig. 2B \u25b6). In order to get further insights into the conformation that the regions of NTAIL encompassing residues 401\u2013485 and 506\u2013525 adopt in the complex with XD, we used the program package CREDO, which is an extension of GASBOR and calculates the position of missing loops in crystal structures. The results obtained with several independent runs using the crystal structure of XD\u2013NTAIL486\u2013505 as the template, revealed at one side a peptide chain in an extended conformation and at the other side a chain packed against the bulky portion of the XD\u2013NTAIL486\u2013505 complex. The extended conformation, which protrudes from the globular cluster of the complex and points to the solvent, corresponds to the 92-residue-long N-terminal region of the NTAILHN construct. In contrast, the more compact peptide chain, corresponding to the 20-residue-long C-terminal region of NTAIL (aa 506\u2013525), always packs against the XD\u2013 NTAIL486\u2013505 complex but at varying distances and positions. An example of one of the calculated conformations is shown in Figure 2C \u25b6. The experimental data were fitted by these models with similar \u03c72 of about 0.8\u20131.0 (see Fig. 2C \u25b6, inset). The various possible conformations provided by the program CREDO together with the extended structural properties of the complex (as indicated by the distance distribution function, the Rg and the restored shape, with respect to the number of amino acids of the complex) are typical of disordered polypeptide chains lacking a stable regular structure. Accordingly, the structure shown in Figure 2C \u25b6 represents only one possible conformation found by CREDO among many others. Indeed, CREDO restores only one conformation per run, and therefore cannot account for multiple conformations due to disorder when fitting the data. Therefore, although a unique conformation of the NTAIL region encompassing residues 506\u2013525 cannot be derived, all the solutions provided by CREDO consistently revealed a packing of the C-terminal region of NTAIL against XD. The recurrence of these packed conformations suggests that the C-terminal region of NTAIL interacts with XD.",

In these pseudomodels, the N-terminal region of NTAIL is in the same conformation as in the credo model shown in Figure 2C \u25b6. The only difference concerns the orientation of Box3, which points out of the complex, in different solvent-exposed conformations. Noteworthy, the theoretical scattering curves calculated from these pseudomodels using CRYSOL (Svergun et al. 1995) poorly fit with the experimental curve, with an average \u03c72 of ~7.0 (data not shown). This confirms that the C terminus of NTAIL does contribute to the observed scattering profile, thus attesting the reliability of the model provided by CREDO.",

In all cases, most recombinant protein was recovered from the soluble fraction of bacterial lysates (Fig. 3B \u25b6, lanes SN). The NTAIL deletion proteins were purified to homogeneity (>95%) in two steps: Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC), and gel filtration (Fig. 3B \u25b6). The identity of the recombinant products was confirmed by IP studies using anti-N Cl25, anti-flag, and antihexahistindine tag mAbs (data not shown). As shown in Figure 3B \u25b6, the three NTAIL deletion proteins migrate in SDS-PAGE with an apparent MM of either 20 kDa (NTAIL\u03943 and NTAIL\u03941) or 18 kDa (NTAIL\u03942,3) (expected MMs are 14.5, 13.4, and 11.5 kDa, respectively). This abnormal migratory behavior has already been documented for NTAIL, where mass spectrometry analysis and N-terminal sequencing gave the expected results (Longhi et al. 2003). The anomalous electrophoretic mobility is therefore due to a rather high content of acidic residues, as frequently observed in intrinsically disordered proteins (Tompa 2002). Likewise, the behavior of the truncated NTAIL proteins can probably be accounted for by this sequence bias composition.",

Reactions conformed to a 1:1 ligand-substrate (Langmuir) binding model, exhibiting an excellent fit (i.e., a \u03c72 value <1 and residuals within the range of \u00b12) following global analysis of sensorgrams. Binding reactions between XD and NTAILHNFC exhibit an equilibrium dissociation constant of 80 nM (see Table 1). The XD binding affinity for NTAIL\u03941 (50 nM) is similar to that of NTAILHNFC indicating that Box1 does not participate in binding. In contrast, removal of either Box3 alone or Box2 plus Box3 results in a strong decrease (three orders of magnitude) in the equilibrium dissociation constant, where NTAIL\u03943 and NTAIL\u03942,3 display similar binding affinities (see Table 1). The strong decrease in the affinity resulting from removal of Box3 clearly indicates that Box2 is not the sole region involved in binding to XD, and attests that Box3 also plays a role in the interaction with XD, as already suggested by SAXS studies.",

            "text": "The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of NTAIL deletion proteins at neutral pH are typical of unstructured proteins, as seen by their large negative ellipticity at 198 nm and very low ellipticity at 185 nm (Fig. 4A\u2013C \u25b6). The solvent 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) mimics the hydrophobic environment experienced by proteins in protein\u2013protein interactions, and is therefore widely used as a probe to unveil disordered regions having a propensity to undergo an induced folding (Hua et al. 1998). Thus, we have recorded CD spectra of NTAIL deletion proteins in the presence of increasing concentrations of TFE (Fig. 4A\u2013C \u25b6). All proteins show an increasing gain of \u03b1-helicity upon addition of TFE, as indicated by the characteristic maximum at 190 nm and minima at 208 nm and 222 nm (Fig. 4A\u2013C \u25b6). In the case of NTAIL\u03943 and NTAIL\u03941, most unstructured-to-structured transitions take place in the presence of 20% TFE, a concentration at which the \u03b1-helical content is estimated to be about 13% (using the ellipticity at 222 nm) (Fig. 4D \u25b6). On the other hand, in the case of NTAIL\u03942,3, TFE concentrations as high as 30% are required for most pronounced unstructured-to-structured transitions to take place (see Fig. 4B \u25b6). Moreover, in the presence of 30% TFE, the \u03b1-helical content of NTAIL\u03942,3 is not only lower (11%) than that (16%) of NTAIL\u03941 and NTAIL\u03943, but also lower than the \u03b1-helical content observed at 20% TFE for the two other NTAIL deletion proteins (Fig. 4D \u25b6). Therefore, NTAIL\u03942,3 displays the lowest \u03b1-helical potential, while NTAIL\u03941 and NTAIL\u03943 exhibit a folding propensity similar to that observed for NTAIL (Longhi et al. 2003; Bourhis et al. 2004). These results, beyond confirming that the region spanning residues 489\u2013516 affects the folding potential of NTAIL (Bourhis et al. 2004), suggest that neither Box1 nor Box3 contribute to the \u03b1-helical propensity of NTAIL, in agreement with the secondary structure prediction provided by PSIPRED (McGuffin et al. 2000) and PHD (Rost 1996), which both predict an \u03b1-helix (residues 489\u2013504, see Fig. 3A \u25b6) as the sole secondary structure element within NTAIL.",

In contrast, an equimolar amount of PCT is sufficient to produce the same effect (Longhi et al. 2003; Bourhis et al. 2004). This difference can be accounted for by a lower affinity of NTAIL towards XD, compared to PCT, rather than to the formation of a 1:2 or 1:3 stoichiometric complex. Indeed, formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex between XD and a peptide corresponding to residues 477\u2013505 of N, has been documented using isothermal titration calorimetry (Kingston et al. 2004b). The higher affinity of NTAIL for PCT compared to XD could be ascribed either to cooperativity phenomena among the different XDs within the PCT tetramer (Rahaman et al. 2004) or to the possible contribution of other PCT regions to binding. This latter possibility can be ruled out based on recent data pointing out XD as the sole PCT region contributing to binding (Kingston et al. 2004b; S. Longhi and M.J. Oglesbee, unpubl.).",

Moreover, the fact that NTAIL\u03943, NTAIL\u03941, andNTAIL (Longhi et al. 2003; Bourhis et al. 2004) share similar folding propensities suggests that the contribution of Box3 to the interaction can be accounted for more in terms of binding rather than of induced folding.",

Because of its small amplitude, this shift most likely does not reflect a conformational change. Nevertheless, it is indicative of a change in the chemical environment of these residues resulting either by direct interaction with the partner or by local magnetic perturbations of residues spatially close to the newly formed \u03b1-helix. Based on this experiment, however, the determination of NTAIL residues involved in these two types of shifts is not possible.

In particular, the calculated overall envelope of the complex shows the presence of a globular cluster of invariant size at one extremity and of an elongated protuberance with varying shapes. The elongated protuberance corresponds to the 92-residue-long N-terminal region of NTAIL, while the more compact region accommodates the structure of the XD\u2013NTAIL486\u2013505 complex as well as the 20 C-terminal residues of NTAIL. Data from overall shape calculations thus clearly indicate that the C terminus is not protruding towards the solvent, and remains close to XD. On the other hand, attempts to more precisely model the conformation adopted by the C-terminal region of NTAIL within the complex led to an ensemble of solutions. In all these solutions, the C-terminal region of NTAIL always packs against the XD\u2013NTAIL486\u2013505 complex, rather than being extended and exposed to the solvent. Identification of the possible gain of regular secondary structure within the C-terminal region of NTAIL is beyond the resolution limits of SAXS. However, results provided by CD, fluorescence spectroscopy, and heteronuclear NMR all converge to suggest that the C-terminal region of NTAIL does not gain any regular secondary structure (see below). Besides supporting a role for the C-terminal region of NTAIL in the interaction with XD, these data also indicate that most of NTAIL remains disordered within the complex. The prevalent disorder of NTAIL within the complex is in agreement with other data reported in the literature where an intrinsically disordered protein largely preserves its overall extended conformation even after interaction with a binding partner (see Tompa 2002, and references cited therein; Permyakov et al. 2003). Finally, it is noteworthy that in the SAXS model the N terminus of XD is exposed to the solvent (see Fig. 2B \u25b6), a position that would accommodate the remaining part of P.",

In particular, the largest movements are observed for the side chains of residues Arg15 and Glu17 of XD (corresponding to residues 472 and 474 of P). The Arg15 NH2 atom moves 9.7 \u00c5 away in the chimeric structure compared to the structure of XD alone, while the Glu17 C\u03b4 atom undergoes a shift of 2.5 \u00c5. These two residues are both located within the loop connecting \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices, and occur at least 9 \u00c5 away from Box2, thus ruling out the possibility that the observed spatial rearrangements they undergo could be ascribed to Box2 embedding. The significant displacement they undergo in the complex therefore indicates that binding of Box2 induces local conformation changes in XD that could favor interaction with Box3. The surface displaced residues of XD could, in fact, be part of a Box3 binding site.",

            "text": "The KD value between NTAIL and XD, as measured by both fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance, is in the 100 nM range. Surprisingly, this value is considerably lower than that reported by Kingston et al. (2004b) (13 \u03bcM) and derived from isothermal titration calorimetry studies. A weak binding affinity, associated with a fast association rate, would ideally fulfill the requirements of a polymerase complex, which has to cartwheel on the nucleocapsid template during both transcription and replication. However, a KD in the \u03bcM range would not seem to be physiologically relevant considering the low intracellular concentrations of P in the early phases of infection. Moreover, such a weak affinity is not consistent with the ability to readily purify nucleocapsid\u2013P complexes using rather stringent techniques such as CsCl isopycnic density centrifugation (Robbins and Bussell 1979; Stallcup et al. 1979; Robbins et al. 1980; Oglesbee et al. 1989). Our data support a higher affinity between P and N, resulting in a stable P\u2013NTAIL complex that would be predicted to hinder processive movement of P along the nucleocapsid template. In agreement with this prediction, Box3 has been shown to have an inhibitory role upon transcription and replication, as indicated by previous minireplicon experiments, where deletion of Box3 enhanced basal reporter gene expression (Zhang et al. 2002). We can speculate that the transient nature of the NTAIL\u2013XD interaction might be ensured by the possible intervention of cellular and/or viral cofactors. Indeed, the requirement for cellular or viral cofactors in both transcription and replication has been already documented in the case of measles (Vincent et al. 2002), respiratory syncytial (Fearns and Collins 1999), and Ebola viruses (Hartlieb et al. 2003). These cofactors may serve as processivity or transcription elongation factors and could act by modulating the strength of the interaction between the polymerase complex and the nucleocapsid template. Such a mechanism may explain the stimulatory effect of hsp72 on MV transcription and genome replication, an effect mediated by Box3\u2013hsp72 interaction (Zhang 2002). In this capacity, hsp72 may neutralize the contribution of Box3 to a more stable complex between P and NTAIL, thereby promoting successive cycles of P binding and release that are essential to polymerase processivity.",

The amphipathic helix \u03b1B of pKID interacts with a hydrophobic groove defined by helices \u03b11 and \u03b13 of the partner. The other pKID helix, \u03b1A, contacts a different face of the \u03b13 helix. This mode of interaction is reminiscent of that occurring between NTAIL and XD. Similarities concern the involvement of two distinct sites within the disordered domain (where Box2 and Box3 resemble helices \u03b1B and \u03b1A, respectively) and embedding of an \u03b1-helix within a hydrophobic cleft delimited by \u03b1-helices from the structured partner. The difference concerns the mode of interaction of the second site, where Box3 of NTAIL does not gain any regular secondary structure element, contrary to \u03b1A of pKID.

This unstructured domain adopts an \u03b1-helical structure when bound to the TAZ1 domain of CBP. However, binding of the same region of HIF\u03b1 to an asparagine hydroxylase results in a highly extended conformation, which is required for the enzymatic activity of the latter. These findings provide an elegant example of the plasticity that intrinsically disordered proteins display for different partners involved in different functions. We can speculate on a similar behavior in the case of NTAIL. In particular, Box2 and Box3 of NTAIL interact both with at least two distinct partners, P and Hsp72, and competition between XD and Hsp72 for binding to NTAIL has been recently shown (Zhang et al. 2005).

Purified XD (1.4 \u03bcg/mL in acetate buffer at pH 5.5) was covalently bound to carboxy-methyl groups of CM5 sensor chips using amine-coupling chemistry (Biosensor AB, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The levels of immobilized XD were comprised between 180 and 225 RU (1000 RU equal a change in mass of 1 ng/mm2 on the sensor surface) (Zhang et al. 2002). Kinetic and equilibrium constants were calculated from global analysis of reactions with multiple analyte concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 \u03bcM). Reactions were performed at 25\u00b0C. Remaining flow channels on the sensor chip included a control for a nonspecific interaction with the sensor chip (i.e., activated/blocked flow channel) and a control for nonspecific interactions with irrelevant protein targets (i.e., lactoferrin conjugated flow channel). Protein analytes were passed over the sensor chip in HBS-P buffer (0.01MHEPES at pH 7.4, 0.15MNaCl, 0.005% surfactant P-20) containing 2.5 mM magnesium acetate and 2.5 mM ATP. Sensorgrams plotted changes in surface plasmon resonance (measured in RU) as a function of time. Multiple sensorgrams representing various analyte concentrations were analyzed by using BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Background interaction of NTAIL proteins (i.e., analytes) with the sensor surfaces were measured on flow channels that were activated and subsequently blocked under buffer conditions used to immobilize XD. This background was subtracted from all binding curves (i.e., sensorgrams) prior to global analyses. Immobilized lactoferrin was used as a specificity control, and the resultant sensorgrams ruled out high affinity interactions between NTAIL constructs or peptides and this irrelevant protein ligand (data not shown). Global fitting of experimental data to well-characterized binding reactions was used to define reaction rate and equilibrium constants. Signal changes on the activated/blocked control channel were subtracted from the peptide\u2013XD and NTAIL protein\u2013XD interactions using in-line reference and the subtracted sensorgrams were analyzed. Curves generated with serial analyte concentrations were applied globally to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model with or without correction for baseline drifting depending on baseline status. \u03c72 and residual values were used to evaluate the quality of fit between experimental data and individual binding models. Plots of residuals indicate the difference between the experimental and reference data for each point in the fit. The \u03c72 value represents the sum of squared differences between the experimental data and reference data at each point. A good fit between experimental and reference data has small residuals in the \u22122 to +2 range that randomly distribute about the X-axis, and \u03c72 values are less than 10.",

Structural variations of NTAIL proteins were measured as a function of changes in the initial CD spectrum upon addition of either increasing concentrations of TFE (Fluka), or different amounts of XD or lysozyme (Sigma). CD spectra were measured between 185 and 260 nm, at 0.2 nm/min and were averaged from three independent acquisitions. Mean ellipticity values per residue ([\u0398]) were calculated as [\u0398]=3300 m \u0394A/(l c n), where l (path length)=0.1 cm, n=number of residues, m=molecular mass in daltons, and c=protein concentration expressed in mg/mL. Number of residues (n) are 140 for NTAILHNFC, 131 for NTAIL\u03943, 103 for NTAIL\u03942,3, 120 for NTAIL\u03941, 132 for NTAIL W518, 56 for XD, and 129 for lysozyme, while m values are 15,626 Da for NTAILHNFC, 14,523 Da for NTAIL\u03943, 11,539 Da for NTAIL\u03942,3, 13,440 Da for N TAIL\u03941, 6690 Da for XD, and 14,300 Da for lysozyme. Protein concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL were used when recording spectra of both individual and protein mixtures. In the case of protein mixtures, mean ellipticity values per residue ([\u0398]) were calculated as [\u0398]=3300 \u0394A/{[(c1 n1/m1)+(c2 n2/m2)] l}, where l (path length)=0.1 cm, n1 or n2=number of residues, m1 or m2=molecular mass in daltons, and c1 or c2=protein concentration expressed in mg/mL for each of the two proteins in the mixture. The theoretical average ellipticity values per residue ([\u0398]Ave), assuming that neither unstructured-to-structured transitions nor secondary structure rearrangements occur, were calculated as follows: [\u0398]Ave=[([\u0398]1 n1)+([ \u0398]2 n2 R)]/(n1+n2 R), where [\u0398]1 and [\u0398]2 correspond to the measured mean ellipticity values per residue, n1 and n2 to the number of residues for each of the two proteins, and R to the excess molar ratio of protein 2. The \u03b1-helical content was derived from the ellipticity at 220 nm as described in Morris et al. (1999).",

The excitation wavelength was 290 nm and the emission spectra were recorded between 300 nm and 540 nm. Titrations were performed in a 1-mL quartz fluorescence cuvette containing 1 \u03bcM NTAILW518 in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7, and by gradually increasing the XD concentration from 0.05 \u03bcM to 3 \u03bcM. Experimental fluorescence intensities were corrected by subtracting the spectrum obtained with XD alone (note that XD is devoid of tryptophan residues). Data were analyzed by plotting the relative fluorescence intensities at the maximum of emission at increasing XD concentrations.
