            "text": "Every year the influenza A virus causes human infection with varying severity depending on the host acquired immunity against the particular virus strain. Three to five million people experience severe illness and 0.25 to 0.5 million people die of influenza yearly worldwide (WHO EB111/10). The influenza virus evades host immunity by accumulation of point mutations (drift) in the major surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) or by reassortment of segments from different viruses co-infecting the same cell leading to a new stain with a HA (and NA) not seen in the population before (shift). In the worst case, shifts may cause pandemics. There have been three pandemics the last hundred years, the Spanish flu in 1918 (H1N1), the Asian flu in 1957 (H2N2) and the Hong Kong flu in 1968 (H3N2). It is believed that new pandemics emerge through shifts with strains from the avian reservoir, as was the case of the pandemics of 1957 and 1968, or by direct introduction of an avian strain into the human population as suggested for the 1918 pandemic [1]. At present only two of the 16 possible HA subtypes (H1 and H3), and two of the nine possible NA subtypes (N1 and N2) are circulating in man. H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A viruses have co-circulated in the human population since the re-emergence of H1N1 in 1977, increasing the possibility for genetic reassortments. The prevalence of the different subtype combinations may vary from season to season. The H3N2 has been the predominant influenza A strain during the last 20 years, with the exception of the 1988\u20131989 and 2000\u20132001 seasons where H1N1 infections dominated [2]. In the 2000\u20132001 season a new reassorted human strain, H1N2, emerged in Europe and became established in the autumn 2001 [3,4]. The new H1N2 subtype was covered by the 2002\u20132003 H1 and N2 trivalent vaccine components and because both H1 and N2 viruses had circulated the previous years some degree of herd immunity against the new strain was expected. The H1N2 viruses were not associated with severe influenza illness that season. In 2002, a new lineage A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like emerged in Asia and caused significant outbreaks on every continent [5,6].",

One single H1N2 virus isolate was also observed this season. The A/Wellington/1/04(H3N2)-like lineage, the following season (2004/2005), had drifted into a more A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like lineage, causing a revision of the vaccine composition from A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2) to A/California/7/04(H3N2) [9]. In 2005\u20132006 the 2004\u20132005 A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like lineages continued to circulate together with the slightly different A/Wisconsin/67/05(H3N2)-like viruses (Figure 2).

The phylogenetic trees of NA and the internal genes showed the same topology (Figure 3 and 4). The lineage II strains are characterised by a deletion K130 in HA (K134 in H3 numbering) (Table 1). H1N1 virus was again isolated in 2004\u20132005 and showed a homogeneous distribution in the lineage II for all genes (Figure 3 and 4). Higher nucleotide variation was observed among the 2005\u20132006 H1N1 sequences in both HA and NA genes (Figure 4). This could indicate that the H1N1 viruses are in progression, away from the A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like viruses.",

The FEL method found one site in the H3 protein (n = 204), position 199 (p = 0.046) to be positively selected, while the more conservative SLAC analysis found none. No positive selected sites were predicted for the N2 genes (n = 166) and none in the internal genes (n = 15) estimated by FEL and SLAC. The REL analysis retrieved four sites in the M1 gene to be selected namely positions 208, 211, 218 and 219.

Many of the substitutions in HA introduced with the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses have become fixed, probably reflecting a very fit virus. The genetic variation before the 2003\u20132004 season may have been more influenced by introduction of new viruses through viral migration than adaptive evolution of the genes. A constant rate of drift was not observed for HA but instead periods of change followed by stasis periods. The low dN/dS ratios (0.232 for HA and 0.247 for NA) also indicated that the influenza genes were not directly influenced by positive selection. Reassortments between co-circulating strains and viruses from previous seasons, and introduction of viruses from other parts of the world might play a larger role than natural selection for some seasons, as also observed by others [27,28].",

The 2002\u20132003 season was clearly a turning point in regard to circulating influenza A H3N2 viruses in Denmark and caused a mismatch in the herd immunity of the population and in the protection of the seasonal influenza vaccine containing the A/Moscow/10/99(H3N2) strain [29]. The fitness of the Fujian-like viruses in Denmark was increased by a reassortment event in 2003\u20132004 when drifted HA A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses acquired the rest of the genome from A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like viruses seasons before. The reassortment has also been observed for isolates from New York State [28]. This reassorted strain caused the only epidemic in the study period in Denmark. The increased fitness could have been a result of a more effective New York-like NA, compared to the weak Fujian-like NA circulating the season before shown by others [30]. The HA genes from viruses circulating after 2002\u20132003 are derived from the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses. The viruses circulating in the 2005\u20132006 season had few variations in HA and NA compared to the viruses circulating the season before. However; the internal genes of the A/Wisconcin/67/05(H3N2)-like viruses, especially PA, NP and M, were more realated to the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses rather than the previous seasons A/California/07/04(H3N2)-like viruses.",

A variant of A/Beijing/262/95(H1N1)-like viruses with the K130 deletion was isolated in New Caledonia in the southern Pacific in 1999, A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like viruses (lineage II). These viruses replaced the A/Bayern/7/95(H1N1) lineage (lineage I) [31] as was also the case in Denmark. Subsequently the northern hemisphere vaccine composition was changed from A/Beijing/262/95(H1N1) to A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1) for the 2000\u20132001 season [32]. Since the introduction of the A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like viruses to Denmark in 2000\u20132001 there have been few substitutions in the glycoproteins. This is also seen in the rest of the world and the H1N1 component in the trivalent vaccine recommended for the northern hemisphere has been A/New Caldonia/20/99(H1N1) since 2000\u20132001. The greater variability of the 2005\u20132006 H1N1 viruses observed in the phylogenetic trees possibly indicates that the virus is changing.

The HA substitution D144N was however not responsible for the antigenic drift of the Fujian-like viruses. It has been shown that only two amino acid changes, H155T and Q156H, specified the antigenic difference from Moscow-like to Fujian-like [37], both are located at antigenic site B. The T155 and H156 amino acids have been maintained in all Danish isolates after the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses. With the A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like viruses in 2004\u20132005, site 145 has changed from K to S in some isolates and to N in others. S145 has been found at this position before 1999 and N145K was the only cluster-difference substitution between isolates from the seasons 1987/1989 and 1992/1995 [38]. It was therefore suggested that substitutions at this site alone could have large antigenic effect.

The preferred antigenic site in the change from A/Moscow/10/99(H3N2) to A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses was site B. This observation is in accordance with previously published data [39]. One region in HA, position 225 to 227, that influence antigenic site D, has changed drastically during the study period from GVS \u2192 DVS \u2192 DIP \u2192 NIP. The influence of antigenic site D was first apparent in the antigenic change from Fujian-like viruses to California-like viruses; however, the antigenic site B was still the preferred site for antigenic change. It has been proposed that a minimum of four substitutions in two or more antibody binding sites are required for an epidemically important strain [40]. The 2002\u20132003 A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses in Denmark had changed at eight positions in four HA antigenic sites and three changes in two NA antigenic sites compared to the 2000\u20132001 New York-like viruses. The change from Fujian-like to California-like viruses involved seven changes at three HA antigenic sites and two changes at one NA antigenic site. The vaccine composition was subsequently changed for the 2005\u20132006 season [9]. The 2006\u20132007 vaccine composition was again changed to include A/Wisconsin/67/05(H3N2). The observed difference from circulating Danish California-like to Wisconsin like viruses involved only two substitutions at two antigenic sites in HA and one in NA.",

The A/Wisconsin/67/05(H3N2)-like viruses from 2005\u20132006 introduced the K221E substitution, both found in the antigenic site B. Neuraminidase substitutions inducing resistance to neuraminidase inhibitory drugs like amantadine might include one or more of the amino acid residues 119, 152, 274, 292 and 294 (N2 numbering). The most frequent NA substitutions observed in vitro are the active site residues E119G/D/A and R292K [22,42-45]. The substitution H274Y is the only neuraminidase resistance mutation identified in H1N1 viruses to date [46,47]. Danish isolates did not possess any resistance mutations in the NAs. Neuraminidase inhibitory drugs are rarely used for influenza prophylaxis or treatment in Denmark.",

The reason for this higher degree of conservation is that 80% of the antibody epitopes are located in the variable glycoproteins HA and NA, while only 40% of the T-cell epitopes are found in these proteins [48]. Recent research has shown some degree of escape from CTL-mediated immunity in addition to escape from neutralizing antibodies [28]. In our dataset we found several substitutions in regions involved in protective T-cell response [48] in NA, PA, M1, NS1 and most in the NP protein. This is not unexpected because most T-cell epitopes are defined for the NP protein and this protein is the main target for the cytotoxic host immune response [49,50]. The extensive variations in the T-cell epitopes during 1999 to 2006 suggest that these regions and the antibody epitopes are working together for efficient escape from the host defence responses.",

These types of drugs are not used for prophylaxis or treatment in Denmark. The S31N substitution is therefore not a local introduced resistance mutation. We cannot exclude that this substitution has arisen by chance, but it is more likely that the mutation has emerged as a resistance mutation in other countries like the USA [52] and Australia [53] where the prevalence of amantadine resistance is high. The resistance may also be related to the increased use of this drug in Asia during the SARS epidemic [21].",

It has been shown that positions 186, 226 and 196 are critical determinants for egg growth. The changes G186V and V226I increased egg viral replication of A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2) viruses so did the changes G186V and A196T for A/California/20/99(H3N2) viruses [56,57]. On the contrary, others have stated that the V226I change in combination with T155 and H156 do not result in viral recovery in eggs [37,54]. This might explain the delay in the 2006\u20132007 vaccine production for the northern hemisphere due to egg propagation difficulties with the A/Wisconsin/67/05(H3N2) strain. The influence on replication efficiency by the other substitutions observed at receptor binding sites should be investigated further.",

Substitutions at antigenic site B and the predicted N-glycosylation at position 144 in HA antigenic site A together with a stronger NA might have contributed to the increased infectivity of the reassorted Fujian-like viruses of the 2003\u20132004 season, causing an epidemic in Denmark. We have shown that the preferred antibody epitope for genetic change is antigenic site B for the Danish dataset also reflecting that site A is camouflaged by glycosylation. Thus the antigenic changes at a glycosylated site A may not play a major role in escape from the immune system as long as the glycosylation is present.",

The majority of isolates from 2003 to 2006 have lost the site at position 93 which is located in a CTL epitope (HLA-A*0201) region of NA [12]. The recent NAs may therefore be more easily recognised by the cytotoxic immune system. We found two predicted N-glycosylation sites (61 and 70) in the N2 NA stalk region in sequences from 1999\u20132006. Greater density of carbohydrate in the stalk region of NA might reflect a need for proteolytic protection. The two observed carbohydrates in the stalk have been reported for other isolates in other time periods and other continents [58,60]. The stalk region has therefore stayed unchanged and the two sequons seem to be conserved.",

We observed that the HA1 region and the M2 protein have a slightly higher global dN/dS ratio than the other genes (Table 3). This is consistent with the findings of others [11,61]. The M2 protein is a membrane ion channel protein on the surface of the virus molecule, a higher dN/dS ratio for this protein compared to the internal proteins is expected. The ratio might, however, be biased because the M2 protein is spliced from M and the dS is suppressed for overlapping regions giving a higher dN/dS ratio [11].",

In our H3 dataset (n = 204) site 199 was influenced by positive selection as calculated by FEL analysis, but no positively selected sites were found applying the more conservative SLAC method. Position 199 may be involved in receptor binding and influence on the virus ability to grow in eggs [10]. In a similar study on a slightly larger dataset (n = 284) positions 220 and 229 were found to be positively selected [11]. Another study found positions 13 and 236 [62]; however, suggested positively selected sites may vary by the dataset applied, method used and the significance level selected for a site to be classified as positively selected. REL analysis identified four sites (208, 211, 218 and 219) in M1 under positive selection pressure. REL analysis tends to give better estimates on small datasets than SLAC and FEL. Sites 211, 218, and 219 were still selected when the bayes factor cut-off was increased from 50 to 200. Further analysis would be needed to determine if these sites actually are positively selected.",

Sites with dN>dS with a <0.05 significance level for likelihood ratio test (LRT) were implied as positively selected for the large HA and NA datasets.

This method is expected to calculate positively selected sites more accurately in small datasets.
