            "text": "Previously, we showed that these tRNA Ser CAGs would have originated from the serine tRNA corresponding to codon UCG . This suggests an evolutionary pathway in which conversion from A to m 1 G would have taken place at position 37 just after the emergence of tRNA Ser CAG had brought about a change in the universal code. Since such a mutation at position 37 might potentially result in the leucylation of tRNA Ser CAG, we attempted to elucidate the charging properties of these tRNA Ser CAGs both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the results of in vitro aminoacylation reactions using tRNA variants constructed by the microsurgery method, the direct analysis of aminoacylated tRNAs in cells and a genetic approach, we demonstrate here that these serine tRNAs are actually leucylated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, m 1 G at position 37 was found to be indispensable for the leucylation of tRNA Ser CAGs. In fact, the tRNA Ser CAG of C.cylindracea, which has A at position 37, exhibits no leucylation activity. C.cylindracea has a high G\u03e9C content (63%) and utilizes CUG as a major serine codon. However, the other Candida species have no such high G\u03e9C content and utilize the CUG as a minor serine codon (Kawaguchi et al., 1989; Lloyd and Sharp, 1992; our unpublished observation) . Considering the relationship between the usage of the codon CUG as serine and the leucylation properties of tRNA Ser CAG, it seems that only Candida species with a genome in which the incidence of the CUG serine codon is very low possess serine tRNA Ser CAG that can be leucylated. Furthermore, such tRNA Ser CAGs charged with heterogeneous amino acids should be utilized equally in the translation process. This is the first demonstration that a single tRNA species is assigned to two different amino acids in the cell. We propose designating this type of codon having multiple amino acid assignment as a 'polysemous codon'. The correlation between the dual-assignment state and the pathway of genetic code diversification is also discussed. ",

The radioactivities remaining on the origins probably came from the direct acetylation of some nucleotides in the tRNAs, as discussed previously (Suzuki et al., 1996) . From comparison with the radioactivity of acetylserine, it was calculated that~3% of the tRNA Ser CAG was attached with acetylleucine. These results were reproducible.",

As controls, mutant plasmids of pCSU-positive control experiments, all the transformants grew normally ( Figure 5B , middle row). However, in the absence CTG, in which the codon CTG was replaced by either the serine codon TCT or the leucine codon CTC, were of uracil, cells harboring pCCU and pCSU-CTC showed normal growth, whereas no growth was observed in those constructed and named pCSU-TCT and pCSU-CTC, respectively. In addition, a plasmid (pCCU) consisting of harboring pCSU-TCT and pUTH18 that contained no URA3 gene insertion. Cells harboring pCSU-CTG showed the URA3 gene of C.maltosa having a CTT leucine codon at the corresponding site, combined with the C.maltosa-weak but significant growth ( Figure 5B, uppermost row) . These results demonstrate that if the codon at position 45 specific promoter, was also used as a positive control. These variant plasmids were introduced into a URA3-is translated as leucine, active ODCase will be produced and the cells will be able to grow, but translation of the defective C.maltosa strain CHU1 (his5, ade1, ura3::C-codon with serine will produce inactive ODCase and the We believe that tRNA Ser CAG is the only molecule responsible for the leucine insertion corresponding to cells will be unable to grow. The result with cells harboring pCSU-CTG clearly demonstrates that the URA3 mutation codon CUG in C.maltosa cells, based on the following obervations. We have purified and sequenced a number on the C.maltosa chromosome was in some way complemented by the introduced pCSU-CTG plasmid, suggesting of leucine and serine tRNAs from Candida species, in which codon CUG is translated as serine, and failed in that the CTG codon was read at least partially as leucine in C.maltosa cells possessing tRNA Ser CAG.",

Incorporation of 5FOA with ODCase results in the formation of 5-fluorouridylate, amino acid from other structurally related amino acids at the adenylation reaction step, and its cognate tRNAs from which is harmful to cell propagation (Boeke et al., 1984) .

It is known that many examples exist for alternative decoding of universal codons-initiation codons other obtained in the in vitro experiments. We consider that such a reduction in leucylation is due to the competition than AUG (Gold, 1988; Kozak, 1983) , leaky stop codons caused by nonsense suppresser or native tRNAs (Murgola, for the tRNA Ser CAG between SerRS and LeuRS in the cells. Despite this competition, the distinct detection of 1985), the UGA codon used for incorporation of selenocysteine (Leinfelder et al., 1988) and so on. However, leucylated tRNA Ser CAG in vivo supports the existence of an ambiguous aminoacylation reaction toward the single because of strong dependence on the context effects or possible secondary structures of mRNAs, these recoding tRNA Ser CAG species. The polysemous codon results from the coexistence of events are those which are programed in the mRNAs (Gesteland et al., 1992) . We have sequenced several genes tRNA identity determinants for serine and leucine in a single tRNA molecule.

In contrast, the tRNA Ser CAG of C.cylindracea, which has A at the same the influences of the neighboring regions in mRNAs. Alternative decoding of a polysemous codon CUG is position, is deprived of such leucine-accepting activity.

Consequently, LeuRS tRNA Ser CAG increased the efficiency of in vitro translation by 2-to 3-fold (data not shown). The negative effect of is unable to recognize tRNA Ser CAG at all, and G33 concomitantly loses its function as a modulator. LeuRS G33 on translation may indicate involvement in some mechanism for decoding the polysemous codon. This is, of course, unable to recognize other serine isoacceptor tRNAs corresponding to universal codons, because they possibility needs to be clarified by further study.

How did this interaction between LeuRS and the suppression of leucylation, and we consider that the nucleotide at position 33 is not directly involved in tRNA Ser CAG evolve?

It has been generally considered that reconstructed tRNA does not lose its activity during the several reaction First, the homology between tRNA Ser CAGs in group 1 and its isoacceptor tRNAs for codon UCG is higher than steps needed in the microsurgery method, such as cleavage of the tRNA strand and ligation of tRNA fragments that between the tRNA Ser CAG from C.cylindracea and its isoacceptor . Second, C.cylindracea (Ohyama et al., 1985) . However, a slight reduction of leucylation activity was observed in the control variant, (group 2) possesses high copy numbers of the tRNA Ser CAG genes (~20 copies) on the diploid genome (Suzuki z-G33G, compared with that of the native tRNA ( Figure  3A , right-hand graph), which turned out to result from et al., 1994) , while low copy numbers (two or four copies) are observed for group 1 tRNA Ser CAG genes (Santos the partial deacetylation of 4-acetyl cytidine (ac4C) due to acid treatment of the 5\u0408-half fragment (see Materials et al., 1993; Sugiyama et al., 1995; T.Suzuki, personal observations) .

To and then the 5\u0408-and 3\u0408-half fragments were separated by 10% PAGE fish out the aminoacyl-tRNAs, we designed two 3\u0408-biotinylated DNA containing 7 M urea (10\u03eb10 cm). Four hundred and thirty micrograms probes: 5\u0408AGCAAGCTCAATGGATTCTGCGTCC3\u0408 for C.cylindracea of the 5\u0408-half and 520 \u00b5g of the 3\u0408-half fragments were recovered from tRNA Ser CAG and 5\u0408GAAGCCCAATGGAACCTGCATCC3\u0408 for the gel. The purified 5\u0408-half fragment was dephosphorylated with C.zeylanoides tRNA Ser CAG. These probes were immobilized with strepbacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo), and G33 at the 3\u0408-end of tavidin agarose (Gibco BRL) as reported previously (Wakita et al., 1994) . the 5\u0408-half fragment was removed by oxidation with sodium periodate as described in the literature (Keith and Gilham, 1974) .
