            "text": "Pandemic and seasonal influenza are still a challenging field of the public health system. Influenza - a mild to severe respiratory infection caused by RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae - is one of the most common vaccine-preventable disease in travellers. Worldwide, between 250'000 and 500'000 deaths are estimated to be due to seasonal influenza infection each year [1]. Influenza is also responsible for tremendous economic costs both from admissions to hospital and loss of productivity [2]. Influenza affects all age groups and is usually self-limited. Common symptoms include acute fever, muscles pain, headache, cough and chills [3]. Special risk groups, such as very young children, the elderly and those suffering from chronic lung or heart diseases are at risk for serious influenza complications, e.g. bacterial pneumonia [4,5]. Influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter in the Northern hemisphere (Nov-Apr) - as well as in the Southern hemisphere (Apr-Oct) and circulates year-round in the tropics [6,7]. Seasonal influenza vaccination is an effective prevention strategy and is therefore routinely recommended for special risk groups [8,9]. Of note, the seasonal influenza vaccine recommendations of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control were recently expanded and include now about 80% of the population [10].",

Individuals above 17 years, understanding German or English, residing in Switzerland and planning to travel to a resource-limited destination were included. Questions included demographic data (gender, age, nationality, education, profession), travel-related characteristics (destination country, duration of stay, influenza risk perception, previous travel health advice, travel purpose, travel costs) and general attitudes and practices towards influenza vaccination (vaccination coverage, reasons to be vaccinated, reasons to refuse vaccination, motivations to consider vaccination with options for multiple answers except for the vaccination coverage). In 2010, an additional question targeting the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccination coverage was included. The questionnaires were checked for completeness. A written letter of exempt was received by the Ethical Commission of the Canton of Zurich.",

Odds Ratios (OR) were determined by stepwise backward elimination of variables with p > 0.150.

Of note, previous influenza vaccinations facilitated receiving an influenza vaccination in the following year by about 13 times. Therefore, easy access to the influenza vaccine is important. High media coverage was not considered sufficient to increase the vaccination rate substantially as is indicated by the low increase of the vaccination coverage between the two surveys in 2009 and 2010 and also by the low pandemic influenza vaccination coverage of only 14.2%.

Therefore, our sample may represent a best practice sample. The fact, that the high proportion of university graduates indicates a health literate population may result in an even overestimated risk perception as well as influenza vaccination coverage. All data collections relied on self-reported information.
