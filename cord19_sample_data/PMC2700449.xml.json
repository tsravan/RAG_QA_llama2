That such phenomena occur has been recognized for many years, and it is known to be responsible for the cyclical episodes of transcontinental outbreaks of influenza that have taken place. The best known is the 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, which claimed more lives than were lost in World War I.[5] Though birds are the main reservoir, other species, including horses, pigs, and humans may easily become infected with the virus. The ability of H5N1 to infect many species rules out the possibility of eradication. Further, as the virus moves from one species to another it will exchange genetic material that will allow for easy mutations and the emergence of a virus with new characteristics.[6]",

Dead poultry seems to be the most infectious; while, handling ill poultry or defeathering, slaughtering, or cooking infected birds is believed to involve less risk. Herein lies the challenge of containing the spread of AI: in many countries back-yard farming remains a common practice and an important source of domestic income. Most disease transmission occurs from domestic animals.[7] A recent report from Azerbaijan describes transmission from wild birds, where humans acquired the infection while slaughtering wild swans;[8] however, the risk of wild birds transmitting the disease to humans is low. The risk of human-to-human transmission is also low and the reports of the appearance of disease among clusters of patients were most likely due to exposure to infected birds as a common source of infection.[910] Until human-to-human transmission is better understood, human bodily fluids such as respiratory secretions, urine, feces, and blood must be considered potentially infectious.",

Independent risk factors for human infection with AI were described by Dinh et al. in Vietnamese patients and included the preparation of sick or dead poultry for consumption and having sick poultry in the household at any time within the last 7 days; in addition, the lack of an indoor water source was also identified.[14] Raising or preparing healthy poultry for consumption was not associated with AI infection.",

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the consequences of an outbreak during the hajj will have a global impact as the Kingdom hosts over 2.5 million pilgrims a year from all over the world.[434] The MOA has detailed the emergency measures and a prevention plan for HP AI in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These measures include several critical steps to prevent the introduction of HP H5N1 into poultry farms: e.g., banning the importation of poultry and poultry products and food from countries with endemic AI; isolating those who return from endemic areas to work on poultry farms for at least 10 days; isolating poultry farms and storage areas from exposure to migratory and wild birds; and, lastly but importantly, educating workers and owners of poultry farms on appropriate preventive measures and early reporting of ill or dying poultry to the MOA.[35] Strict policies on destruction of infected and exposed birds, as well as farm decontamination, are clearly detailed in the plan. In addition, the designation of an area within a 5-km radius of an infected farm as a \u2018restricted area\u2019 is a critical factor in successful disease control; this is necessary in order to survey the area for newly infected birds. Within the restricted area, all birds dying due to any reason are to be dealt with as if they have died from AI. Additional measures include banning the exit of any heavy machinery or birds from the restricted area for a period of 6 months from the date of identification of the last diseased bird. Only after 6 months of consistently documented absence of newly identified cases can the farm and the surrounding area be opened up for full access.[35]",
