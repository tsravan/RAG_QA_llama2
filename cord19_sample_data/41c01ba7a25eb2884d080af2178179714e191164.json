First, zoonotic regulation and control pose a special case for public health agencies, and this paper proposes a propositional model for an effective public health stance. Second, globalization dynamics are briefly reviewed in terms of an emerging consensus on the need for global governance in public health. Third, a brief examination of global governance modalities suggests that a strong global governance case has distinct limitations (despite its possible justification); an exploration of contemporary directions in global governance follows. Finally, the paper examines the phenomenon of contemporary zoonotic control within the conditions of an effective regulatory regime.",

The structural framework and dynamics of public health define the parameters of how emerging mechanisms of global governance are likely to influence the control of zoonoses.

I then discuss how the dynamics of contemporary globalization influence the transformation of both social and governmental behavior. I review the notion of \"regimes\" of governance that embrace trans-national and supra national entities. Finally, I inquire about the conditions for an effective regime for zoonoses control via global governance.",

Indeed, a review of competing definitions of public health by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the United States in 1988 led the IOM to define public health as \"fulfilling society's interest in assuring conditions in which people can be healthy\" (2) . This broad definition, were it to be taken seriously and public policy aligned with it, would create a politics in which state power potentially could invade every private activity that challenges health. Pursued with vigor the political power of the state could develop into a national \"health police\".",

Ticklish regulatory issues are also raised by the so-called new public health in which individuals are held to be primarily responsible for their own health. In the latter regulatory regime, responsibility shifts from the state (e.g. to regulate noxious industries) to the individual (e.g. to take responsibility in avoiding the products of noxious industry.) The regulation of smoking falls very much within this paradigm. Current controversy over eating behaviors, resulting obesity, and the impact on the \"public's\" health are of the same character, as are efforts to hold mothers criminally responsible for ingesting \"dangerous\" substances during pregnancy (ranging from methamphetamines to alcohol and tobacco). As political scientists look at these issues, health as a value always stands in dynamic tension to other rights and values (e.g. wealth, liberty, rectitude, etc.) What societies negotiate at any given moment is the relative authority to be given one value weighed against another. The ultimate policy questions become how much authority will health values and those who espouse and affect them have in society, and at the opportunity cost of what else (3)?",

As new diseases emerge, each simultaneously is \"fitted\" into the prevailing model of regulation, even as they challenge that application. National and transnational regulation of beef herds under threat of a BSE infection is a case in point. Equally important, however, has been the level of state fiscal support for public health. Even as the dynamics of globalization increase health threats to the public, the prevailing ideology of neo-liberalism through which state policy is filtered leads to a diminution of state authority and diminished resources for public health disease control (5).",

Already it is obvious that basic consumption patterns related to health are changing, as societies become more consumer oriented. Changes in diet, work and living patterns are associated with goods through which we fashion our identities and make choices. Castells, like Harvey, sees the rate and nature of change the central element of how globalization impacts society, a process that he calls the creation of network societies. This contemporary process of change has the apparent property of being high recursive; elements of change in one dimension affect another through chains of reciprocal causation, working themselves back to the initial causal elements and producing new, and often unexpected, effects in the process. Social theorists make strong analogies to how ecological systems function recursively in making these operations. When these new and complex recursive processes occur within the social stew of hyper-urbanization, the outcomes are highly unpredictable (17) .",

One component of this migration is cross-border, legal and illegal migrants seeking work. This pattern, however, is dwarfed by within-country migrations which have brought hundreds of millions of people into cities, now perceived as the critical nodes of global production, and therefore the locus of jobs. In many of these cities, especially the \"newly large\" cities of the developing world, or the mega-cities of Asia, living and working conditions resemble those of Dickensian England. At the current edge of the 21st century's world, industrialism coupled with urbanization has reproduced the social conditions of the 19th century.

Defining zoonoses in terms of a set of problems within the discovery-tocontrol continuum is analogous to the weak program for global governance. It accepts the premise that important public health situations constitute problems to be solved by intense, expert, scientific driven problem solving techniques.",

A dilemma differs from a problem in that the situation it \"contains\" will not produce a \"solution\" at the level of analysis at which it stated. Simply: within a dilemma one cannot continue to do what one is doing-the thing that produces the \"problem\"-and gain an effective solution. In the above analysis, the world cannot continue to embrace and support the activities of contemporary globalization and meet the public health problems it will create. To resolve the dilemmas that constitute global public health requires changing (perhaps in radical ways) the ways that globalization works, so that it will produce different results. Problems say: do more; dilemmas say: do something different. This is what proposals for global governance purport to do. The all-important question is, even were they to succeed, through the reforms proposed, would these be sufficient to create transformations in globalization behavior yielding different outcomes? One should never say never. I am tempted to argue, nevertheless, that we cannot solve the problem of creating an effective regime of zoonotic control because such a regime, as posited, would not change the conditions of the global economy that are producing the very diseases one wants to control.",

For example, I have made much of the tension between the current world of infectious disease in which there is a large, and perhaps ever increasing, need for more research, more science, more data bases, more trained personnel and international cooperation on policy implementation, all of which cost money (and involve additional contribution of resources on the part of the state), and the trend under current globalized regimes of neo-liberalism to actually weaken the state, to shrink public spending and to weaken its regulatory hold. Following this logic suggests to me two conclusions.",

In the contest of values and public policy discussed in section one of this paper, particularized interest will triumph over more generalized interests. Two, some disease will present itself with such threat and virulence that its consequences to existing society cannot be ignored. In the face of this manifest crisis (perhaps a breakout of the current Thai-based avian flu virus), public health intervention will go to the top of the policy list. Not only public monies will be made available, but also private sector funds. William Gates or Warren Buffet, or George Soros or some other combination of the world's largest holders of private wealth may seek to intervene to transform the direction of current public policy. And that might turn the tide on the existing threat.",

Yet threats of this magnitude have failed to mobilize an effective interventionist regime. While it is useful to speculate on some of the reasons that such a regime has not emerged (e.g. the disease emerged outside the developed world (non \"us\"), and then proliferated in stigmatized populations, wide spread denial of the size and extent of the disease by many governments, etc.) the combination of urgency of impact (disease incidence continues to rise) and failures in the establishment of an effective governance regime (typified by the failure of the U.S. government to contribute its full share to the global fund) shows that the HIV/AIDS pandemic has new lessons for us about how crisis dynamics do and do not work to effect appropriate responses.",

Like health, risk is a socially constructed category that changes within the complex norms and values of a given society or culture. What is an acceptable level of risk at one period of time, may not be in another; what is an acceptable level of risk for one group (e.g. others), may not be for another (e.g. ourselves) 8 . Notions of risk are negotiated within the political process; notions of crises, their relative severity and the amounts of resources to be devoted to them emerge from the complex processes of bargaining within the political process. When the site of the political process is global, rather than national, and when the mechanisms for decision making lack the force of national sovereignty, the complex calibrations of acceptable risk compound exponentially.",

We are wise enough to realize that technology can bring astonishing immediate benefits, but also through unexpected recursive feedback loops, create yet new and unanticipated problems, perhaps as severe as those they were designed to fix. Nevertheless, at the very least microtechnology and nano-technology hold enormous promise for assisting with surveillance tasks to control disease spread. Biobased sensors that can be made cheaply and sensitive down to the individual molecule level promise new ways of scanning large numbers of people (e.g. airport arrivals) cheaply and with minimal intrusiveness. Nano-tech sensors operating within the bodies of suspected infectious persons are also being studied. To see the individual as the broadcasting site for disease surveillance strikes many as a further draconian incursion into the oppression of individual liberty\u2026but to return to our opening theme, this tension between private interest (including the self) and the public's health is endemic.",

            "text": "This is not a pessimistic paper, although it may read like one. It makes a simple argument. Globalization is about the deployment of capital throughout the world through marketprivileging mechanisms. Globalization has a powerful up side in the vast wealth that has been created through its mechanisms, and the benefits that it brings to millions of people every day. (The World Bank for example estimates that 400 million people in China have been lifted from poverty by the mechanisms of the current capitalist based society.) But globalization also has its dark side, some of which is eluded to above, and which can be easily amplified in reference to the millions throughout the world who work in conditions that are unregulated, dangerous and underpaid 9 ; to the emergence of a world-wide sex industry tied to human trafficking that acts as a particularized HIV/AIDS reservoir; to the wanton disregard of private enterprises in many parts of the world to environmental destruction; to corruption and theft in the higher levels of some of the largest corporations in the world, global trafficking in arms and drugs, etc. 10 My argument is in the end simple: the dynamics of globalization have become the major \"factor\" in the social production of disease, including those elements that are intimately associated with the emergence of zoonoses. Directly addressing how these globalization dynamics impact human populations to produce disease must be a program for global governance 11 . It must look beyond a discovery-to-control paradigm for emergent diseases, to a research-to-prevention-to-discovery-to-control paradigm. Within these mechanisms of governance lay the difficult tasks of regulating capital in its excesses. This-to repeat my earlier point-was the basic issue in the development of national economies, and it is of necessity the basic issue in the creation of global governance. To succeed, these issues must enter the discourses of global governance in a direct way (and not be viewed as some exotic side issue). I conclude by repeating a portion of the previous quote from Nayyar and Court. Global governance means: \"This would mean providing global public goods, such as world peace and a sustainable environment, as well as regulating global public bads, such as international crime whether trade in drugs, arms, people, or [human] organs. It will be necessary to reform existing institutions and to introduce new rules or create new institutions. Some of these would require a system to correct for the failures of unregulated or liberalized international markets\u2026\" 9 An especially egregious instance exists in China, in which hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of peasants moving into cities have over the past decade been employed in myriad construction projects, including many proceeding under the approval of government authority. A current suit is being conducted on behalf of these workers who are owed $42 BILLION in unpaid wages. This is a country in which annual individual income is still a pittance. It is no secret who benefits and who loses from such a situation (18) . 10 The next great crisis in globalization has already begun to emerge. As capacity spread through out the developing world for labor-cheap manufacturing, countries such as Bangladesh became early players in the inexpensive manufacture of world goods. The rapid integration of China and India with their enormous labor forces into world markets is threatening to overwhelm other countries in this role, creating capital movement and resulting unemployment and deepening poverty. One adds to this the opening wedge of service industry outsourcing from the developed word, from low level work, e.g. call centers, to the highest levels of professional training. Radiologists in the United States (average income north of $300,000) may be replaced by those in India (average income of around $25,000); similar issues exist in engineering, computer programming and medical technology. Singapore, acutely aware of the implications for this threat is investing heavily to upgrade the country's professional labor force to better gain niches in scientific and technological research. As the deputy minister for development told me some months ago, \"we can make all the capacity we need to stay competitive; we rent brains. It is cheaper and more efficient.\" (The opportunity in question arose from the U.S. government's decision in 2002 not to pursue stem cell research.) In this view of research, only a portion of it needs to be site specific. 11 This argument accords with the general thrust of Burci and Vignes in their recent review of WHO, in which they argue for a strong step beyond what they see as the legal timidity of the organization in the direction of a stronger \"normative stance\" (22) .",
