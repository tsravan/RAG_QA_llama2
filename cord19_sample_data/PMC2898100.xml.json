Jasanoff 1990; Guston 1999; Bijker et al. 2009; Huitema and Turnhout 2009), at the role of experts in policy development (Rutgers and Mentzel 1999; Nowotny 2000; Hoppe 2005, 2009; Turnhout et al. 2008) and at policy cultures, or their absence (Hellstr\u00f6m 2000; Halffman and Hoppe 2005; Halffman 2005). In this context, a biographical approach has two major advantages. First of all, a biographical approach allows us to study the individual views of the experts themselves and the assessments of their own roles. Secondly, a biographical approach allows us to flesh out the relationship between experts, policymaking and public communication.",

Hoppe, for instance, described the views of scientific experts as boundary workers, and discerned several ways of looking at the science-policy boundary (Hoppe 2009). Huitema and Turnhout (2009) focus on the institutional level and describe the \u2018political\u2019 roles of experts working in a Dutch boundary organisation. Claire Waterton (2005) also focused on the science-politics boundary, in particular in the field of research policy and funding. Together with Sarah Davies (2008), who describes the views held by scientists regarding the science-public boundary, these authors analyse the outlooks of individual scientists working across the boundaries of their organisations and disciplines. One of the challenges of discussing the views of scientists in the science-policy and science-public zones is to point out how each of the experts acted in these boundary zones and how they negotiated tensions within these zones, creating an identity for themselves in the process.",

In this paper we will look at the experts and their expertise from a relational or social role perspective (Collins and Evans 2007, p. 2). We treat the role of experts not as a given solid state, but as something in flux. This flux is the net result of interactions between the actions of individuals, and the attributing of trust and credibility by others (viz. Goffman 1959, pp. 15\u201316; Wynne 1992, p. 282; Huitema and Turnhout 2009, p. 579), turning the experts into \u2018hybrid characters\u2019 (Daston and Sibum 2003). A role in this understanding cannot be attributed solely to what the individual expert wants. Roles are contingent outcomes of these interactions, in which trust and credibility play a crucial part.",

Crises as focusing events challenge experts to inform and comment on the crisis, to assist in the development of appropriate policies, and more generally to sketch the prospects of where the crisis is heading (Birkland 1997). Understood as such, we will see how crises function as springboards for experts from relative invisibility to visibility, and how experts are thus invited or forced to develop their own style of crisis management. Some authors point to the strategic use of crises in inducing policy change (Kingdon 1995; Birkland 1997; Weingart et al. 2000). These sources demonstrate that a crisis is not something that \u2018just happens\u2019 to experts, but that experts, as policy entrepreneurs, also shape and give voice to crises. They tend to use moments of crises to \u2018capture attention for their causes\u2019, at times even by \u2018overselling to the media\u2019 (Weingart 1999, p. 159; see also Edwards 1999, p. 169).",

The experts also commented on each other in these interviews. The third step was to organise the data temporally, hereby focusing on the diachronic data (data on events, their relations and the effects of events). This step included the collection of additional data, for example by conducting a second round of interviews.

The labels used to structure these narratives must likewise be seen as provisional headings. As to the methodological validity of the narratives that emerge in this manner, it is important to see that the production process of narratives takes place on various levels. The first level is the level of the actual events as experienced by the experts involved, the so-called lived story (Rosenthal 2005, p. 27; Wengraf 2000). Subsequently the experts themselves will reflect on these events retrospectively and from a certain distance. This level can be referred to as the told story. Finally, as a result of the interactions, post hoc reflections and reframings between interviewee and researcher,2 the written story as a third level of narrative emerges3 (Littig 2008, par. 17). Thus, the written story builds on the two previous levels, and care is taken to secure the internal validity through iterative data collecting and interview sessions, as is also the case here.",

The Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are the two major policymaking bodies in the domain of infectious diseases, while local (Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdiensten, GGD) and national (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, RIVM) public health institutes have an executive task. University Medical Centres (UMCs) play a more independent role. A central advisory body is the Dutch Health Council (Gezondheidsraad, GR). The Health Council is an advisory body that presents the \u2018state of affairs\u2019 of science, and explicitly advises policy, it does not make it (Interview Knottnerus & De Visser. 30 January 2006; Bijker et al. 2009). In 2005, the Centre for Infectious Disease Control was established as a specialised body for scientific advice and outbreak control, emerging as a new boundary organisation in the Dutch institutional landscape (CIDC, see Ministry of Health 7 December 2004). The Dutch advisory sector for infectious diseases can thus be characterised as a \u2018corporatist policy arrangement\u2019, with a restricted and formally accredited set of experts that act on personal title (Halffman and Hoppe 2005, p. 137; Bijker et al. 2009, pp. 85\u201386). On an international level we find the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza (ESWI), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and of course the World Health Organization (WHO).",

For the virologists this was a moment to once again assume visibility in public debate and involvement in policy development. The first H5N1 deaths marked the advent of a second crisis. Besides fears of an avian influenza pandemic, scientists and politicians were concerned about the growing threat of bioterrorism and outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. Finally, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 came as a complete surprise. It was SARS that highlighted the real danger of pandemic outbreaks, but that also triggered the awareness of preparedness and prevention plans as new instruments in preventing a pandemic from developing to its full capacity (Osterhaus 6 March 2009).",

As chairman of the EEC Scientific Veterinary Committee he acted cautiously. Nevertheless, he met with scepticism, since pointing out the possible public health dangers went against the grain of policymakers. He did not refrain from setting policy machinery in motion, and a proposal for legislation on the various dangers of BSE was issued almost monthly. In his opinion, this had its effect on policy processes (Osterhaus 29 July 2008).",

This disagreement with the environmentalists challenged Osterhaus to prove he was right, and he conducted extensive experiments with seals. To his surprise these studies did identify pollution as a contributing factor in the seals\u2019 deaths, but as an indirect causal factor: it made them less resistant. Osterhaus considered this a success: he had discredited his own hypothesis and discovered a causal chain more nuanced than either he himself or Greenpeace had expected (Osterhaus 6 March 2008). The research on seal death, that started in 1985 and has continued ever since, has had an enormous impact on several aspects of Osterhaus\u2019 career. It delivered him his first four Nature publications in 1988 and 1989, and many other papers followed.

However, as homosexuals were in a process of emancipation, they feared discrimination and blame for bringing HIV/Aids into the world. Disease prevention did not outweigh this concern. Since Coutinho saw that both homosexuals and drug users tended not to take the danger of infection seriously (as they had previously done with venereal diseases), he used the statistics to make them aware of the scale and nature of the epidemic. His rationale was that without being open about a problem, one cannot start solving it. Also, covering up the truth implies a disdain for society and is likely to result in a loss of credibility (Coutinho 13 May 2008; Mooij 2004; Andere tijden 26 November 2002).",

On a more personal note, being struck by influenza himself made him experience the severity of flu. These personal, professional and scientific experiences with flu would from now on become a dominant factor in his contact with policy and the media (Osterhaus 29 July 2008). In 1995, he made some initial, cautious remarks that hinted at the lurking threat of influenza (Trouw 17 February 1995). But in 1997 the cautiousness gave way to a much more alarming message when the first human bird flu casualty was reported (Osterhaus 6 March 2008). Osterhaus and others wrote a letter to Nature entitled A Pandemic Warning (De Jong et al. 1997), in which they referred to H5N1 as a virus with \u2018unknown pandemic potential\u2019.

In 1992, the former was very confident about the prospects for such a vaccine (Trouw 24 March 1992); but just two years later we see a mixed attitude: Goudsmit is still optimistic regarding the possibilities of a vaccine, although he thinks that it will require international coordination and prolonged collaboration (Parool 26 March 1994). That is what he therefore endeavours: in 1994, Goudsmit becomes a co-founder of the IAVI, the International Aids Vaccine Initiative.

This is what in effect changed the way in which he performs as an expert in public.

In addition to his professorship and his extensive policy work, both avian flu and SARS struck in the spring of that year. He became involved in both of them. One moment that Osterhaus especially recalls regarding avian flu is a meeting of the Outbreak Management Team (OMT) to determine the necessary policy. The majority opposed Osterhaus\u2019 policy view, and rather than conforming, he tried to enforce his view by threatening them with a minority point of view, sketching what might happen should the OMT abstain from following his advice. It proved effective, but also demonstrated the fragility of his position: had he not been there, policy would have been very different (Osterhaus 6 March 2008).",

Osterhaus reaped the rewards for the discovery and his status rose (Enserink 2003). But what is more: the WHO prevented a pandemic.

We note that this back region (Goffman 1959), the preparation, remains invisible to the public view; that which is visible in the front region is the knowledgeable expert, who then takes the credit. The role he takes up is that of spokesperson and translator: speaking on behalf of the institute, and translating the specialist expertise residing there to public or political contexts (Coutinho 13 May 2008). There are a number of reasons to do so. First of all, he believes that it is part of his responsibility to carry the risks involved here. Secondly, he is the experienced expert, aware of the intricacies of communication. Thirdly, he enjoys communicating with the media, and this is stimulated by the many successes he has experienced (Coutinho 13 May 2008). Consequently, he is again a familiar face in the media. As the topics have become far less controversial and political than they were during the 1980s, the contributions to policy and to the public sphere are also more technical (determining risks, developing preparedness plans).

Right from the start, they were all simultaneously conducting research, drafting public health or veterinary policy based on that research, and communicating to various publics and patient groups on the diseases. In some cases, communication was used strategically to induce policy change (Birkland 1997; Kingdon 1995), but often enough communication was aimed at solely informing the public on the status quo of outbreaks.",

            "text": "Of the various elements of the experts\u2019 biographies, two aspects stand out from the rest: the personal reflections of these experts on their roles; and the tandem development of governance arrangements and the role of these virologists therein. To start with the first: the biographical approach shows us how the early, trial and error methods of \u2018being an expert\u2019 steadfastly developed into more crystallised views on their roles. The experts based their methods on the early-career understandings of the relationship between science, politics and the public domain. This article opens up the biographical-narrative \u2018black box\u2019 of these experts, and the enactment of that biography in practice (Goffman 1959; Deuten and Rip 2000; Brockmeier and Carbaugh 2001). Learning experiences, personal or communal reflections on specific events, the continuous process of re-narrating and reframing past experiences, all added up to an individual conviction on \u2018how to perform as a credible expert\u2019. In Coutinho\u2019s case, we might say that his self-perception as an expert has not changed dramatically, but solidified in a repertoire of communicating the facts. Goudsmit, on the other hand, following a redefinition of his expertise, radically changed the way in which perceived his role in policy and in public debate. Then we have Osterhaus, who still finds himself in a continuous balancing act between a credible scientist, a policy entrepreneur, a public communicator and an industry advisor. The biographical-narrative approach has elucidated how each of them have accommodated themselves in the boundary zone between science, policy and public debate, and thus juxtaposes with a more macro-sociological understanding of expertise, such as Nowotny\u2019s \u2018narrative of expertise\u2019 (Nowotny 2000).",

The studies of Coutinho and Osterhaus demonstrate that since they were pioneers in the development of new governance arrangements, they remained central figures in these arrangements for infectious disease control. The emerging governance structures and the pioneering virologists remained tied together. It is no accident that when the CIDC was being set up, Osterhaus and Coutinho were the prime, if not only, candidate directors. Up until the H1N1 pandemic, these two virologists were the key figures in policymaking and public debate. In cases where new governance arrangements emerge, we can thus expect the leading figures in that process to remain tied to those arrangements. It is certainly relevant to scrutinise the degree in which the experts themselves strive to remain tied, whether the arrangements as such keep them tied, and why. This article demonstrates how the involvement of certain figures is understandable from a historical and biographical perspective.",

Probing these dimensions, as this study does, assists in the assessment of the nature and structure of contemporary governance arrangements, the persons involved and their relationships to science, politics and the public sphere. Although this does not provide a prescriptive approach to expertise, such as that suggested by Collins and Evans (Collins and Evans 2007), it may help to critically question the almost automatic policy involvement of some experts.",

As norms and expectations for credibility and authority change over time, these experts cannot rely on the crystallised understandings of their roles and their settled positions in governance arrangements. During the course of the pandemic, for various reasons, Osterhaus\u2019 and Coutinho\u2019s credibilities were severely damaged and their authorities disputed. Osterhaus\u2019 balancing act could not withstand the growing wave of criticism (Enserink 2009), and Coutinho\u2019s notion of medical authority was challenged down to the bone (Coutinho 2 February 2010). These controversies raise a call for a more thorough reflection on their roles, both within governance and public communication. Answering that call, this article tells us, is a continuous struggle and challenge.",
