In order to understand and control the spread of pathogens, it is essential to establish some of the key parameters associated with disease transmission. Fundamental to the dynamics of an epidemic are two quantities: the basic reproduction number (R0) and the generation time (Tg) of the pathogen [1]. The R0 is the average number of secondary cases produced by each primary case at the start of an epidemic in a previously unaffected population. The Tg is the average time between infection of index cases and the secondary cases they produce. The R0 is a measure of the transmissibility of the strain in the population, and largely determines the proportion of the population that will be infected in a pandemic. The ratio R0/Tg is a measure of an epidemic's rate of growth.",

These models assume that the rate at which new infections are acquired is proportional to the number of encounters between susceptible and infected individuals, and leads to an effective reproductive ratio that depends on a threshold density of susceptibles. Thus, the models depend not only on parameters intrinsic to the disease such as latent and infectious periods, but also on contacts between infectious and susceptible hosts. Historically, structuring the population at risk into compartments permits subpopulations of varying risks to be represented. Compartmental models of this kind implicitly assume that the host population is well mixed, such that the probability of infection is equal for all.",

To overcome the simplifying assumption of classical transmission models, a new type of model is gaining recognition. Agent-based models (ABMs) represent an important new approach for describing interacting heterogeneous agents. The heterogeneous aspect of agents enables more sophisticated and complex environments to be described by ABMs approaches. Also, it is typical to introduce a geospatial dimension into the framework so that both time and geographical patterns are represented. Thus, every ABM run identifies infected persons where they live and work in general, and their movements within groups (referred to as social networks) that influence disease spread. ABMs have been used to describe phenomena from social systems to immune systems, both of which are distributed collections of interacting entities (agents) that function without a leader. Simple agents interact locally according to simple rules of behavior, responding in appropriate ways to environmental cues and not necessarily striving to achieve an overall goal. An ABM consists of a set of agents that encapsulate the behaviors of the individuals that make up the system, and model execution consists of emulating these behaviors [2].",

In response to the MIDAS mission (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-06\u2013106.html), a number of large ABMs describing influenza transmission were developed. The main purpose of the models was to examine possible intervention strategies that would protect the general public from morbidity and mortality should an influenza pandemic strike. One of the initial objectives in all disease transmission studies is to determine the basic R0 value. The goal of intervention is to reduce R0 below the self-sustaining threshold of R0\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}$\\,=\\,$\\end{document}1. The R0 of a future newly emergent influenza strain is unknown, but estimates for previous pandemics are available. For example, an estimate of 1.89 was obtained for the pandemic of 1968 in Hong Kong [3], and the pandemic of 1957 in Great Britain (GB) was estimated to be between 1.5\u20131.7 [4]. Also, the reproductive number of the first wave of the 1918 pandemic in the United States was estimated as 2\u20133 [5]. There is historical evidence that these three influenza pandemics were explosive. The results reported by the MIDAS also suggest that the pandemics can be controlled to some degree. By comparison, childhood diseases such as rubella, pertussis, and measles have R0 values in most populations in the range 7\u201315 [6], and consequently, are much less controllable.",

Generally, estimates of the proportion of infections that occur in the various social contexts such as households, schools, workplaces, and communities have been reported. Then, estimates of relative effect of intervention measures on transmission in each context will need to be established. It would also be useful to know how implementation of a particular measure might disrupt contact patterns in other social contexts. For example, we would like to know the extent to which household and community contacts are increased when schools are closed.",

The best data available only allow the proportion of transmission in households to be quantified [7], [8]. Therefore, while models can give some insight into the likely benefit of single or combined interventions, that insight is somewhat limited by this lack of data. To some extent, the results depend on the assumptions made by the modelers about transmission in the different contexts. The degree of uncertainty does depend on the specific control measures. Modelers can arguably better project the possible effects of antiviral and vaccine use, case isolation, and household quarantine than the effects of school closure, mask use, banning of mass-gatherings, or nonspecific social distancing measures.",

We assert that ABMs are conceptually less mature than computational biology models, and broader in their scope (i.e., agents can represent genes, proteins, and cis-regulatory elements at one end of the spectrum, and represent people, states, and countries at the other end). We chose not to grapple with the notion of trying to develop a common taxonomy to describe agent-based epidemiology models.
