            "text": "The Chinese have had a long history in infectious disease control, and records of epidemics can be traced back two millennia [1]. Since the introduction of modern medicine by missionary doctors in the 19th century [2], modern epidemiological studies have been conducted in China, first by Western doctors, and then gradually superseded by their Chinese colleagues in the 1930s [3]. Since the 1950s, huge reductions in the incidence of infectious diseases like measles and schistosomiasis have been achieved through national vaccination programmes and environmental intervention programmes [1,4]. The adoption of the Open Door Policy in 1978 marked the beginning of remarkable social and economic development unprecedented in China's modern history. However, rapid industrialization and urbanization are accompanied by many social problems, from the increasing rich-poor, urban-rural, coastal-interior disparity to heavy environmental pollution. Changes in disease profile with the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases as a result of an aging population with a successful one-child policy posed new challenges in the 21st century [1]. The SARS epidemic in 2003 exposed how a lack of transparency and delayed dissemination of information on the part of the Chinese government made an epidemic of then unknown aetiology a global problem [3].",

In 1994, the British Medical Journal published an editorial recommending to its readers the Chinese medical journals [5]. However, 13 years have gone by, and the Chinese medical and scientific literature is still largely terra incognita outside China [6]. Recent enthusiasm among Westerners in learning the Chinese language [7,8] may rekindle their interest in this untapped resource. As Beijing prepares for the Olympics in 2008 celebrating China's arrival in the modern world, perhaps an update of the development of Chinese biomedical journals may whet the reader's appetite. This paper is intended to serve as a guide.",

For example, if I type 'bing du' in the Google Scholar English interface, I will obtain journal articles with authors of the family name Bing Du. However, if I use the Chinese interface, I will be prompted whether I actually want to search with the search term  (virus; bing du in Chinese pinyin). If so, by clicking on the prompt, I will be able to get my results for virus in Chinese. Secondly, it supports an automatic interchange between simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore and traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. These two functions are unique to Google Scholar at the moment and are not supported by the other Chinese bibliographic databases.",

The English table of contents is available online, free of charge, through the Wan Fang database. However, the English abstracts are only available in the full text PDF file from the Wan Fang database that requires subscription. (Only the Chinese abstract is available freely online in HTML format.) Thus, if one is unable to read Chinese, then his/her search is limited to 'Titles' and 'Authors' for the articles required. A new approach must be adopted if Chinese scientific journals aspire to secure a wider readership and a higher citation rate. Since the Scientific Electronic Library Online [32] can provide free online access to English abstracts of Spanish and Portuguese journal articles, it would seem appropriate for the Wan Fang database to move towards a similar standard. Of course, English abstracts are available for journals indexed by PubMed or ISI Web of Science.",

Although Science Citation Index Expanded and MEDLINE are primarily bibliographic databases with their main purpose being to search scientific and medical literature, they are sometimes used as pointers to indicate journals of importance. However, as language bias is suspected among these English-language indexing services, it is important to look at the data produced by the Chinese themselves. Among the 5000+ Chinese journals, some are classified as 'core journals'. According to Sun [36], these are indexed by at least one of the following three indexing systems. The first one is Comprehensive Lists of Titles of Chinese Core Journals (zhongwen hexin qikan yaomu zonglan) published by The National Library of China every four years. The latest one was published in 2004 which is available at [37] (username: gjtsg; password: tsgbkb; provided by National Library of China, see [38]). Its function is similar to that of MEDLINE: to indicate which are the top journals for a given field. It takes into account the bibliometric data from 52 databases or abstracting services, awards given by the national General Administration of Press and Publication, indexing by important indexing services (both national and foreign) as well as qualitative peer-review by specialists in the disciplines. In Tables 4, 5 and 6, those journals that were indexed in the Comprehensive Lists 2004 are indicated as 'Chinese core journals 2004' accordingly. The other two 'core journal' databases are the Chinese Science Citation Database [39] managed by the Chinese Academy of Science, and the Chinese Science and Technology Paper Citation Database managed by The Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (cf. [6,26]).",

Some are even considering switching to English completely, e.g. the Journal of Molecular Biology [45]. According to Zhang et al. [46], over 200 English language academic journals have been published in China from 1929 to July 2001. Out of these, more than 150 are published by \"universities or institutions\" in China [47]. Compared to Taiwan and Hong Kong, the share of mainland Chinese academic journals published in English is relatively small. As illustrated by the history of three flagship general medicine journals in greater China (see Appendix 2), socio-political factors often play a role in the choice of language of publication used by a journal. While biomedical journals in Hong Kong have always been published in English due to its British colonial legacy, Taiwanese journals have been switching from Chinese to English in the recent quarter century. My hypothesis is that, due to Taiwan's small population, the internal market for its journals is small. Given that mainland Chinese and Hong Kong readers are unlikely to read Taiwanese journals, these journals switch to English to gain a wider readership (cf. The Journal of the Formosan Medical Society, see Appendix 2). Their situation is not unlike that of journals published in some small European countries [48]. On the contrary, in mainland China, with its huge population and considerable number of scientists and medical professionals, the internal market for biomedical journals is substantial enough to sustain a sizable number of Chinese language journals. Thus I suggest that the size of the prospective market (as a result of the linguistic and political divide) plays a significant role in shaping the language trend of the world's journal publication.",

Hopefully, some of these journals will manage to receive their impact factors from JCR. However, by switching to English and internationalising their scope (e.g. by dropping the word 'Chinese' from their titles), they face severe competition from their counterparts in North America and Europe. Nevertheless, there are a few successes so far, like Cell Research and the World Journal of Gastroenterology: WJG [49] that are now indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded and MEDLINE. As the Chinese share of the world's scientific output increases and as Chinese scientists become more fluent in English, more English language biomedical journals published in China will receive their limelight in the international arena. For further discussion, please refer to Appendix 3.",

One of the criticisms against it is the alleged language bias of the Thomson Scientific database coverage towards journals published in English and in the industrialised world [51,52]. The 'what-if' scenarios of inclusion of non-Science Citation Index (SCI)-indexed journals upon the impact factors of SCI-indexed journals have been studied and the 'hypothetical' impact factors of the non-SCI-indexed journals calculated [52,53]. In order to better evaluate the performances of Latin American journals, SciELO publishes bibliometric indices of its own, similar to that of Thomson Scientific, using data from its database which reflect more the regional context [53]. Brazilians can now evaluate their journals using the SciELO impact factor, rather than relying solely on that published in JCR [54]. Should the Chinese do the same? At the moment VIP Information publishes bibliometric indices using data from its own database [40] (cf. Table 4). These data should be used in our evaluation of the quality of Chinese journals, especially in our fields of epidemiology and public health, as hardly any of these are indexed in Thomson Scientific database. Currently only a sub-set of Chinese journals receive their impact factors from VIP Information. Hopefully, in the future, more journals will receive their bibliometric data, perhaps not only from VIP Information alone, but pooling data from the other Chinese databases as well. In the long run, I envision an international collaboration between Thomson Scientific, SciELO, the Chinese databases and other bibliographic databases to provide authors and editors alike with a more accurate and comprehensive bibliometric data of journal performance by collating data across the various databases.",

Thus, the cost of setting up and maintaining an individual website for a journal may seem to be a potential financial disincentive. Furthermore, most OA journals, like that of BioMed Central [62] and Public Library of Science [63], adopt an author-pay model. In the mainland Chinese context where research funding is inadequate, more often than not, authors are less willing to pay for publication in OA journals. While OA journals in the West can grant waivers to authors from low income countries because their overhead costs are met by membership fees and article processing charges paid by universities and authors from the West, for most Chinese journals this will be difficult as most of their authors come from mainland China.",

Comparing English and German journals, Egger et al. [67] found that randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were more likely to publish in English language journals if they gave statistically significant results. This led to the worry that language bias could be introduced to reviews and meta-analyses restricted to data published in English, leading to distorted results. However, subsequent studies [68-70] found little evidence supporting this assertion. Pham et al. found that language bias led to an under-estimation of the protective effect of intervention in RCTs in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) systematic reviews but not in that of conventional medicine [70].",

In an online rapid response, Peter C. Gotzsche (\"No double standards in research, please\" dated 26th August 2006) argued that Liu et al. had provided no evidence for their statement. The standard adopted by Cochrane and CONSORT by which the Chinese trials identified in [73] are judged to be of poor quality, are not \"Western\" as declared by Liu et al. since they are adopted internationally, including by the Chinese Cochrane Centre. Gotzsche also cited two reviews [74,75] to argue that \"Chinese trials are far more positive, on average, than trials performed in other countries\". In another study, Wang and Zhang found that by 1995, the \"frequency of using statistical tests in Chinese medical journals appears comparable to that in other parts of the world\", but \"the lack or inappropriate use of statistics remains a problem\" [76].",

The Journal of the Formosan Medical Association demonstrated the process of colonisation, decolonisation and internationalisation in its switch of language from Japanese to Chinese and then to English.

The annual number of manuscripts received varied greatly (Table 7). Eighteen journals received manuscripts from outside China, ranging from a few manuscripts per year to 30% of its total number of manuscripts received. The majority of these submissions came from other developing countries. One of the consequences of low supply of high-quality manuscripts is that the frequency of publication of journals in China is low: 19 of the 31 English language journals are quarterly or semi-annual (Table 8) [101].",

As of 2006, eighteen of the 31 journals were distributed internationally, mainly through the agency of international publishing groups, like Elsevier, Nature, Springer and Blackwell. Through collaboration with these publishing groups, Chinese journals can benefit in terms of efficiency, economy of scales and share of the international market. Not only does this illustrate the feasibility of international collaboration, but it also provides Chinese publishers a model of development into a commercially viable publishing group of scientific periodicals. However, only seven of these 18 journals achieved an international circulation of more than 100 copies. This reflects the difficulty of breaking through into the international market.",

Interestingly, by moving towards an international readership, these English language journals of China fared not so well in China either (Table 10). The analysis of Yu et al.
