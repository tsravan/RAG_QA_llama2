Such symptoms are nonspecific and can occur with a large number of common illnesses often associated with NSCLC, or they may be due to cancer progression or lung cancer therapy. These patients are also prone to pneumonia and many have radiation-related injury as a result of prior treatment. Cardiovascular causes of the symptoms, such as fluid overload, congestive heart failure and pulmonary embolus, are not uncommon. Differentiation of drug-associated ILD from these illnesses is difficult and the diagnosis is usually made by exclusion. High-resolution CT (HRCT) is recommended on first suspicion of ILD to provide an assessment of the parenchymal nature of the cause of symptoms.",

It is also advisable to avoid combining agents associated with ILD, such as bleomycin and possibly mitomycin, with other agents that cause lung damage, such as oxygen and radiation, as this may result in worsening of the lung damage. If radiotherapy is indicated in a patient who has experienced mild bleomycin toxicity, then concomitant low-dose corticosteroid may minimise any further lung damage.
