The incidence of TB was of 50 cases/100,000 population/yr in 2006, and recently reached approximately 100 cases/100,000 population in the city of Porto Alegre (southern Brazil) [1]. Every year, almost 2 million people die of TB, most of them in low- and middle-income countries. The annual death rate from TB in Brazil was estimated at 4.0/100,000 population/yr in 2006 [2].",

The HCPA is a general, tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital with 750 beds (34 adult ICU beds) and is a reference center for HIV in southern Brazil. Porto Alegre is the city with the highest acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) incidence in Brazil (68.7 cases/100.000 population) [1]. In our hospital, in 2008 for example, we had approximately 29.000 hospitalizations per year, with 185 cases of pulmonary TB. In addition, the number of outpatient visits was 551.968, but we do not have data on TB treatment, because our hospital does not provide TB treatment for outpatients; in Brazil, patients are treated in public outpatient health care services. The medical records of patients were reviewed, and predictors of mortality were assessed. The protocol was submitted to the Ethics Committee at HCPA and an approval was obtained. A waiver of consent was approved and the investigators assigned a confidentiality term.",

We have chosen this widespread adopted cutoff because using a more traditional level (P < 0.05) might fail to identify variables known to be important. In addition, confusion variables can affect estimates even when their level of significance does not reach 0.05. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze the survival of patients. Those factors significantly associated with survival were further analyzed with the Cox proportional hazard model (method forward) adjusted by sex and age. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to report the results. A two-sided p value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.",

In accordance with our findings, another study demonstrated an ICU mortality rate of 61% and an in-hospital mortality rate of 65.9% [5]. Early ICU admission was independently associated with higher mortality in multivariate analysis. This finding is consistent with a previous study [13], and may be due to the more severe disease in these patients. Actually, this appears to be a plausible explanation as they have a higher incidence of acute renal failure compared to patients with a late ICU admission. Delayed treatment was also more frequent in this group, which confirms earlier observations [13,14]. Another factor that contributes to the failure to initiate treatment within 24 hours after admission is the less classic presentation. Indeed, atypical features as sputum-smear negativity have been suggested to be associated with delays in both diagnosis and treatment and with mortality [13,15,16]. Our study showed that sputum smear-positivity and a miliary radiographic pattern were associated with a reduced risk of death. Surprisingly, we found in univariate and multivariate analysis that VAP was a further protective factor for mortality, in contrast with prior reports [4,17]. Although not statistically significant, the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in survivors compared with nonsurvivors, which could explain the higher incidence of VAP in the formers.",

However, we did not find an association between a diagnosis of HIV and mortality in ICU patients. In fact, mortality in patients with TB-HIV coinfection seems to be related to the patient's overall degree of immunosuppression [21]. In spite of the free access to HAART in Brazil and the high level of immunosuppression of our study population, only 13% of patients were receiving HAART at the time of hospitalization, which is probably related to poor or no adherence to treatment. Even so, CD4/mm3 count was not a predictor of death in these patients. Furthermore, serum albumin levels, reported by others as good predictors of CD4/mm3 lymphocyte counts in patients with TB [22], were not associated with mortality in our study. The lack of association between mortality and the HIV epidemic could be explained by the fact that our non-HIV population had a high proportion of comorbidities and were also too ill with high mortality rate.",

One hypothesis to explain such observation is the possibility of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, culture and sensitivity test to antituberculosis drugs were not routinely performed, so we could not estimate the prevalence of MDR-TB in our sample. On the other hand, uncertain enteric absorption in critically ill patients [23] and subtherapeutic serum levels of rifampicin, especially in HIV-positive population [24,25], have been reported [26-28]. Drug interactions among antituberculosis drugs and HAART are also important factors to be considered. In addition, low serum albumin levels could impair drug absorption and was associated with low rifampicin and ethambutol concentrations [29].
