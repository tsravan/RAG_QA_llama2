            "text": "Sex and gender differences can affect exposure to pathogens, vulnerability to infectious diseases, health seeking behaviours and immune responses to pathogens, resulting in differences between males and females in the incidence, duration, severity and case fatality rates following an infection [1,2]. Sex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define males and females, whereas gender refers to the roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that individual societies consider appropriate for men and women. The impact of sex and gender on infection is tied to the age of the individual, as both biological and cultural factors can change dramatically with age. Consideration of these factors can result in a more effective public health response to infectious diseases, including influenza, and yet they are often inadequately addressed in clinical and basic research studies. A systematic review of the literature regarding sex, gender, pregnancy and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic indicates these are important factors which alter the severity of the disease as well as the prevention and treatment measures. A greater awareness of how sex and gender impact upon the biology of 2009 H1N1 infection could provide important insights into the unique morbidity and mortality patterns associated with this pandemic.",

Factors such as obesity and hypertension are not normally associated with severe disease from seasonal influenza but have been suggested as risk factors for severe disease from 2009 H1N1 in some studies [5-7].",

            "text": "The protective immunity induced by influenza vaccinations is mediated primarily by antibodies that recognize the viral haemagglutinin protein and neutralize virus infectivity. After virus infection, host innate immune responses, including production of cytokines and chemokines, are activated which initiate a cascade of immunological events that lead to the development of specific immune responses to the virus. Controlling and clearing influenza virus infection requires neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity (for example, activation of T cells) [3]. The influx of immune cells into an influenza-infected lung can lead to the overproduction of various cytokines and chemokines - often called a 'cytokine storm' - which can enhance the virus-induced lung damage resulting in severe illness. A limited number of studies suggest that an altered cytokine and chemokine response is contributing to severe 2009 H1N1 disease [8,9]. Therefore, immunity to influenza viruses represents a balance between immune responses inducing protection and clearance of virus versus causing pathology.",

Reported male-female differences in the incidence of infection vary with age in several countries, with a higher incidence of infection with 2009 H1N1 in young women than young men of comparable age [12-15]. While pregnancy has been clearly linked with increased disease severity, the vast majority of infected females of reproductive ages are not pregnant, suggesting that additional factors are contributing to the increased incidence of infection. In contrast, in Asia, the majority of reported H1N1 cases have been male (57.1%) [16,17]. In China, males (male odds ratio [OR]: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.07-2.66) also shed the 2009 H1N1 virus in pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples for a longer duration than females [18] suggesting that the transmission potential may be higher in males. Other countries reported no male-female differences in the number of cases of 2009 H1N1, but did not analyse the data stratified by both age and sex [19-25].",

Initial analyses of data from critically ill patients in the USA during the first wave reported no male-female difference [27], but subsequent state-specific reports from the first and second waves illustrated differences between the sexes [28-30]. In Canada, a significant majority of critically ill patients have been young women (female RR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.6) [5,31]. Other countries also report that rates of hospitalization have been higher among females than males, with a majority of the females being of reproductive age (15-49 years of age) [14,32-36]. Analyses of cohorts of patients in Mexico and Australia/New Zealand revealed a trend for more females than males being hospitalized [6,37].

Increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women has been reported in many datasets [5,14,27,28,36,37,41,43-45]. The disease course and clinical presentation [46-48] has been studied and comparisons of disease in pregnant women to age-matched non-pregnant women [37,49,50] or to the general population [51] have been made. Disease severity is increased during the second and third trimester. However, no clear clinical parameter has been associated with pregnancy-associated increased morbidity and mortality. There are no significant differences in the general symptoms of disease, the progression to viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or secondary bacterial pneumonia in pregnant women compared to the control populations. Severe disease was also associated with a greater than sixfold increase in adverse neonatal outcomes when compared with pregnant women suffering mild disease [49]. An increased risk of severe disease may be present during the early postpartum period but the reported number of cases is limited and requires additional investigation [37,50].",

Among healthcare workers in China, 73% of women reported intentions to decline both the H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 vaccines compared to 64% of men [96]. In France, acceptance (either receipt or intention to receive) of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine was higher among men and was higher among pregnant women and other groups with co-morbid conditions [97]. In the USA and Canada, vaccination against seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza during pregnancy is recommended irrespective of trimester [54,98,99]. The vaccination rate of pregnant women against 2009 H1N1 virus has been estimated to be only 38%, which is still higher than that normally seen with seasonal influenza vaccine [91].",

The 2009 H1N1 viruses analysed, to date, are all resistant to the adamantadine class of antivirals but remain sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors [3]. Available data indicate that the rate of prescribing antivirals to seasonal influenza virus-infected individuals, ranging in age from infants to adults, is similar between males and females in the USA [113-115]. In contrast, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for seasonal influenza is greater for women [114]. A meta-analysis of data from randomized, double-blind clinical trials illustrates that, following treatment with oseltamivir, men return to their baseline wellness faster than women, suggesting that antiviral treatment for seasonal influenza may be more effective in men [116]. Whether this observation reflects patient reporting biases, need for differential drug doses or other confounding factors is not clear. These data do, however, indicate that sex and gender should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of antiviral treatment for 2009 H1N1.",

Plasmacytoid dentritic cells (pDCs) are significant producers of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1), which signal the activation of cytotoxic T cells for the elimination of virally infected cells. pDCs from women react more strongly to HIV-1 encoded toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) ligands than pDCs derived from men, resulting in higher levels of immune cell activation [83]. Women with higher progesterone (P4) concentrations have greater numbers of activated pDCs in response to the HIV TLR7 ligand than women with lower P4 concentrations [83]. Several genes (for example, the Tlr7 gene that encodes a receptor that recognizes RNA viruses, including influenza viruses) that encode for immunological proteins are on the X chromosome and may escape X inactivation, resulting in higher amounts of expression in women [117]. X chromosomal variation also alters the course of progression of AIDS differently in women than men [84]. Whether female-biased immunopathology contributes to the severity of 2009 H1N1 disease in women requires consideration.",

In HBV transgenic mice, castration of males reduces, whereas replacement of testosterone in castrated males increases, serum HBsAg concentrations [122]. Chemically-induced hepatocellular carcinoma is more severe in male than female mice, which is mediated by increased inflammatory cytokine production by liver cells in males and can be reversed with oestradiol (E2) treatment [123]. Sex steroids modulate sex differences in the prevalence of HBV and development of liver cancer through effects on immune responses to HBV. Whether sex steroids affect the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection should be examined.",

Recent data illustrate that pregnant women with severe 2009 H1N1 have lower levels of total IgG2 than healthy pregnant women or women with only moderate H1N1 disease [133].
