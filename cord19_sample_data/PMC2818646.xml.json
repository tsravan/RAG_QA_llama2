This effort is largely driven by the need to reduce the impact of Plasmodium falciparum on human life, particularly in African children [1,2]. Part of the difficulty in studying the pathophysiology of P. falciparum malaria is the lack of a permissive animal model and a comparator disease in man. With the recent discovery of severe malaria, caused by the zoonotic parasite Plasmodium knowlesi in the human population of Southeast Asia [3,4], it is now possible to link findings in primates and humans through this common agent.",

First, to provide improved guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and management of severe knowlesi cases. Secondly, when severe knowlesi infection is compared with severe falciparum malaria, this can help clarify determinants of severe disease. Thirdly, it is possible that we are observing a P. knowlesi vertebrate host switch from Southeast Asian macaques to a full-blown emergence into the human population [11,12]. Therefore, it is important to understand properly the disease caused by P. knowlesi to assist strategies to reduce health-impacts if human-to-human transmission of this virulent pathogen is established.",

Neither was up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression detected in endothelial cells, suggesting that the mechanism of sequestration/accumulation of infected erythrocytes in knowlesi infections needs further investigation.

Reticuloendothelial changes in both liver and spleen were associated with pigment, accumulation of red cells and laden macrophages, and some inflammation in liver portal tracts was observed. Circulating pigment has been variably implicated as an indicator of poor prognosis for falciparum malaria [23-25] and there is evidence to support pigment-induced immuno-suppression, particularly of pigment-laden macrophages and monocytes [26-28]. It may be that the associations between parasitaemia, pigmentaemia and disease severity are more quantifiable in knowlesi compared with falciparum infections, where pigmented parasites are sequestered from peripheral blood samples and, therefore, unreliably quantifiable. In vivax malaria, pigment in parasites often appears more dispersed and it is rarely reported as a correlate of disease [29].",

Cytoadherence is often implicated in malaria pathology and is mediated by the expression of variable var gene products (of the PfEMP-1 family) at the surface of infected host red blood cells with concomitant expression of post-capillary endothelial cell receptors [15,30-32]. Although not easily quantifiable, partial sequestration was observed in this fatal case of knowlesi malaria as evidenced by an abundance of large pigment bearing parasites on the blood film obtained post-mortem and as accumulations in the microvasculature. We hypothesize that partial sequestration may be due to P. knowlesi infected cell agglutination mediated by variant surface antigens of P. knowlesi SICA var genes (orthologues of the PfEMP-1 family) [33,34]. Importantly, in this fatal case of P. knowlesi, up-regulation of ICAM-1 was not detected, nor was there evidence for cytoadherence as parasitized cells were not marginalized and were interspersed with uninfected erythrocytes in smaller vessels.",

Although late stages of parasites may be visible in the blood in falciparum infections, they are rare and associated with a poor prognosis. Testing the relative contribution of virulence factors to the development of severe malaria including, cytoadherence, hyperparasitaemia, cerebral malaria, organ failure, metabolic and respiratory dysfunction and anaemia was previously difficult without comparative information from severe malaria caused by another species [16,41-44]. Severe and fatal cases of knowlesi malaria will add much needed perspective to what is known of malaria pathophysiology.",

Complications in survivors included ARDS, liver or renal dysfunction, hypotension with or without parasitaemia >100,000/uL. Complications in all fatal knowlesi cases had either clinical or laboratory evidence of abdominal pain, combined hepatorenal dysfunction and hyperparasitaemia [3,4]. There is a prospect that P. knowlesi may emerge as a human pathogen beyond its current zoonotic manifestations [11,12], specific surveillance, control and clinical guidelines are necessary to contain potential larger outbreaks.",
