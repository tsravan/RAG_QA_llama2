            "text": "Several high risk groups have been identified as \"the priority group\" to receive the influenza A (H1N1) vaccination and among these, healthcare workers have been identified \"as a first priority\" to be vaccinated against influenza A (H1N1) by the World Health Organization [4,5]. Although it is considered essential for all healthcare workers to be immunized against influenza A (H1N1) to prevent the spread of influenza A (H1N1) to patients as the pandemic evolves, previous studies that have examined the acceptability of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers have generally demonstrated a low acceptance rate of vaccination in this group [6,7]. Among all healthcare workers, nurses constitute the largest group with the highest frequency of contacts with patients and staff [8]. Previous findings of the acceptability of seasonal influenza vaccination in nurses showed that their acceptance of vaccination was lowest among all healthcare workers [6,7,9,10]. Acceptability of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination in healthcare workers has been shown to be low [11-13]. A survey conducted in Greece found that only 17% of hospital healthcare were willing to receive influenza A (H1N1) vaccination [11]. Of all healthcare workers, nurses were found to have the lowest rate of acceptability of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination [12,13]. A study of Italian healthcare workers showed 31% of nurses willing to accept vaccination compared to 67% of physicians [12]. In a study conducted of Hong Kong healthcare workers in hospitals, it was found that only 25% of nurses were willing to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination, compared with 47% of doctors and 29% of allied professionals [13]. General practitioners working in the community in France also report a high rate of acceptability of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination at 62% [14]. It is therefore not surprising that a recent online poll conducted in the UK suggested that nurses may be unwilling to receive pandemic influenza vaccination [15]. In a cross-sectional survey that was conducted on experienced nurses who were members of the nursing professional organizations in Hong Kong, the vaccination rate for seasonal influenza vaccination was about 50% [16]. In a more recent survey that explored influenza A (H1N1) acceptance rate in the same group of nurses [17], it was found that only 13% were willing to accept vaccination for influenza A (H1N1) compared to 38% who plan to receive the seasonal influenza vaccination. However, in the study, there was a low response rate of 28% of nurses with different clinical settings. There is a lack of studies in Hong Kong looking at influenza A (H1N1) vaccination acceptability particularly in the community setting. Nurses who work in the community may be the first group to be in contact with patients who are affected with the influenza A(H1N1) infection. A recent study [18] showed differences in the concerns in using new vaccines during a pandemic than using established vaccine in a non-crisis situation. Therefore, we undertook the current study to examine the willingness of frontline registered nurses who work in the community in Hong Kong to receive vaccination against influenza A (H1N1) at the time of a pandemic.",

The first four parts were based on a conceptual framework developed by Patel et al [20] to guide systematic planning for community primary care service response to pandemic influenza with modifications to make it more relevant for nurses. We added a fifth part on psychological responses to pandemic influenza and a sixth part on demographics of respondents which were based on two studies previously published (one on general practitioners' response to SARS and one on general public response to swine flu) [21,22]. In summary, these sections were 1) clinical services change as a response to pandemic influenza; 2) internal environment changes as a response to pandemic influenza e.g. wearing of mask; 3) macro-environmental changes as a response to pandemic influenza e.g. use of guideline etc; 4) professional and public health responsibilities with respect to pandemic influenza; 5) attitude and psychological responses to pandemic influenza; and 6) demographics and year of education of respondents. The willingness to accept influenza A(H1N1) vaccination was asked in the professional and public health responsibility sections and the question \"will you receive the new influenza A (H1N1) vaccine when it is available\" was asked with a dichotomous \"yes\" or \"no\" response. For those who answered no, they were further asked to give their reasons for refusing to receive the vaccine. Only results on willingness of accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination and information related to the analysis on willingness to accept vaccine are reported in this paper. Other results from this survey will be presented in a separate report.",
