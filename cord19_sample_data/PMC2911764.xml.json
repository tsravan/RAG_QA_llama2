            "text": "Liver transplantation is still a complex and cost-intensive procedure [1] and the results are influenced by many interrelated factors. As liver transplantation has become a universally accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease, the number of patients accumulating on the waiting list has gradually outweighed the scarce resources of available organs. Fair allocation of donor livers to patients with end-stage liver disease is a difficult task. The USA and Europe used prioritization systems based on waiting time and on the parameters of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score [2]. Since February 2002, the United Network for Organ Sharing introduced a new allocation policy for cadaveric liver transplants, based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score [3]. This new policy stratifies the patients based on their risk of death while on the waiting list [4]. The impact of MELD score on postoperative mortality remains elusive. There are reports of reduced survival in groups with high MELD scores [5,6], but also reports of no influence of MELD score on survival [7,8].",

Data on the impact of preoperatively assessed MELD score on the morbidity and mortality of postoperative recipients are only few. This study correlated morbidity, but not mortality with the MELD score in patients after liver transplantation in uni- and multivariate analyses and demonstrated a MELD score above 23 to be an independent risk factor for an ICU stay longer than 10 days (odds ratio 7.0). Siniscalchi and colleagues reported a correlation of MELD score and postoperative complications in 242 liver transplants [20]. Interestingly, the MELD scores in that study were similar to our findings (22.8 vs. 22.3 in our study in the high morbidity group and 17.6 vs. 18.8 in the low morbidity group). Another study associated increased length of stay in the ICU in association with high MELD score above 30 [7], but failed to find a difference in mortality. Only in patients exceeding a MELD score of 36, mortality seems to be predicted by MELD as reported from Saab and colleagues [21]. In our population, four patients showed MELD score above 35, three of them died in the postoperative course. In contrast, a study of 340 transplanted patients showed no difference in early death in respect to the MELD score [8]. Several other publications from the USA have also document that MELD score cannot predict survival after liver transplantation [22-24]. Nevertheless, the question of whether very high MELD scores affect mortality remains elusive. Taken together, despite no clear correlation of MELD score and postoperative mortality, there is strong evidence of MELD influencing postoperative morbidity and in turn cost [25].",

Often RRT is needed as a bridging therapy until the kidneys recover. In our study population, if duration of dialysis pretransplant was less than 30 days only 8% of patients still require hemodialysis 8 weeks after transplantation, which is somewhat in contrast to the study by Lo and colleagues, where 25% of the patients with hepatorenal syndrome require long-term RRT after transplantation [43]. Thus, hepatorenal syndrome is not always reversed, in particular when pretransplant RRT is necessary [44] and additional kidney transplantation becomes an option [40].

In patients after liver transplantation, intraoperative transfusion of packed RBCs are associated with more complications [48,49] and infections [50]. Our multivariate analysis revealed transfusion of more than 7 units of RBCs and transfusion of more than 10 units of FFP as independent risk factors for mortality and prolonged ICU stay. Other reports identified intraoperative transfusion as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients [39,50,51] and Massicotte and colleagues could demonstrate that a restrictive transfusion regime was associated with better outcome in liver transplantation recipients with an average MELD of 18 [49]. Thus, avoiding transfusion of RBC seems to be crucial to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.",
