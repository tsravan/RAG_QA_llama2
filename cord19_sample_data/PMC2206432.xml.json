Surfactant dysfunction, destruction and inactivation have also been demonstrated in children with acute respiratory insufficiency due to bronchiolitis [3,4]. The administration of exogenous surfactant may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and its associated sequelae by restoring surfactant levels and function. Inspired by the success of surfactants in reducing mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [5], investigators have studied exogenous surfactant in other populations with various causes of respiratory failure. Trials of surfactant in adults with ALI and ARDS have not demonstrated a mortality benefit [6-9], perhaps due to inherent differences in the aetiology of lung injury in adults, the design features of the trials, the mode and timing of surfactant administration or the type and dose of surfactant used. In children with respiratory failure, the efficacy of exogenous surfactant has been suggested in uncontrolled studies [10,11]. The relatively low mortality rate, the diversity of the study populations and the shorter duration of mechanical ventilation are factors that make large-scale randomized controlled trials in this population challenging to conduct. Two of the largest trials were stopped early due to slower than expected enrolment [12,13]. While the use of surfactant in ARDS/ALI has not been previously systematically reviewed, its use in children with bronchiolitis has been [14].",

We considered effects statistically significant if P < 0.05. A z test was used to statistically test the estimates of treatment effect between groups [16]. We assessed heterogeneity among trials using the I2 statistic, and considered an I2 value greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity [17]. RevMan 4.2 software and a random effects model were used to perform the analyses [18]. We chose the random effects model because it gives a more conservative estimate of the precision of the treatment effects and because the true effect of the intervention probably varies given the different populations enrolled in these trials [19]. A subgroup analysis was planned based on the aetiology of respiratory failure (trials enrolling exclusively patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)/severe bronchiolitis compared with all other trials) if sufficient data were available, because these trials were likely to enrol a younger, more homogeneous, population with a lower predicted risk of mortality. We also planned sensitivity analysis based on methodological features of the included trials (trials reporting adequate allocation concealment compared with all other trials).",

The remaining three trials enrolled a heterogeneous group of patients with ARDS or ALI [12,23,24]. While the individual treatment protocols varied, all trials used comparable doses (50\u2013100 mg/kg phospholipids) of natural or modified natural surfactants and each patient typically received one or two doses. A variety of interventions were used in the control groups: no intervention, air placebo or similar sedation and ventilation manoeuvres without a placebo. Although one study [20] used a modified natural surfactant, all the products used contained surfactant proteins B and C. All studies administered surfactant early in the course of respiratory failure; most patients were treated within 12\u201348 hours of requiring mechanical ventilation.",
