Multistrain diseases are diseases with multiple coexisting strains, such as influenza (Andreasen et al. 1997) , HIV (Hu et al. 1996) , and dengue (Ferguson et al. 1999b) . We consider two kinds of strain interactions: cross immunity and antibody-dependent enhancement. When the disease infects an individual, his or her immune system creates serotype-specific antibodies, which will protect the individual against that serotype. 1 However, there is evidence that antibodies also give some cross-protection to the other serotypes (Halstead 2007) . This reduced susceptibility to the other serotypes is temporary. When the temporary cross immunity wanes, heterologous secondary infections are possible. Low level antibodies developed from primary infections are believed to form complexes with the virus so that more cells are infected, and viral load is increased (Vaughn et al. 2000) . This effect is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and it has been observed in vitro in diseases such as Ebola (Takada et al. 2003 ) and dengue (Halstead and O'Rourke 1977) . Throughout this work we make the hypothesis that ADE increases the infectiousness of secondary infective cases due to the higher viral load Schwartz et al. 2005) . Alternative views of ADE as an increase in mortality associated with secondary infectives can be considered (Kawaguchi et al. 2003) .

The ADE factor \u03c6 is the enhancement in the infectiousness of secondary infectives. \u03c6 = 1 means that secondary infectives are as infectious as primary infectives, while \u03c6 = 2 means that secondary infectives are twice as infectious as primary, and so forth.

For simplicity, we assume that all individuals migrate with equal probability, independent of their infection status. This assumption may be relaxed in a future study. The migration rate is assumed to be slow compared to the infection spread. For convenience, we put it on the same order as the birth/death rate. We assume that the social parameters, which are the contact rate \u03b2 q and birth/death rate \u03bc q , may vary between patches, while the epidemic parameters are the same in all regions. Because the social parameters depend on human factors (and in the case of the contact rate also include mosquito levels, which are weather-dependent), these parameters are the most likely to be different in adjacent regions.

The ADE \u03c6 and cross immunity strength were varied as bifurcation parameters. In the absence of cross immunity ( = 0), ADE alone generates instability, desynchronization, and ultimately chaotic outbreaks Schwartz et al. 2005) . A Hopf bifurcation is observed for a critical value of the ADE factor \u03c6, above which oscillatory solutions are obtained. Weak cross immunity stabilizes the system, while strong cross immunity triggers instability and chaos even in Table 1 the absence of ADE (Bianco et al. 2009 ). In the latter case, destabilization occurs via a Hopf bifurcation for a critical value of the cross immunity strength . At the bifurcation, three identical complex pairs of eigenvalues of the Jacobian simultaneously become unstable. Although Bianco et al. (2009) discusses the full two parameter bifurcation structure (in and \u03c6), we will consider the cross immunity and ADE effects separately in the present work. Figure 2a shows the bifurcation behavior of the single patch model with no cross immunity as the contact rate \u03b2 is varied. The bifurcation structure was computed using a continuation routine (Doedel et al. 1997 ). The ADE value at which the bifurcation occurs increases slightly as \u03b2 increases, and the dependence is approximately linear. The period of the periodic orbit, shown in Fig. 2b for a fixed ADE value, also varies with \u03b2. (Note that multistrain models with ADE can display subcritical Hopf bifurcations, Billings et al. 2007 , so the periodic orbit shown in Fig. 2b exists throughout the range of \u03b2 values shown.) Similarly, varying the contact rate \u03b2 in the absence of ADE affects the location of the Hopf bifurcation in cross immunity and its characteristic frequency of oscillation.

Our results suggest that if control strategies in one region are able to generate enough asymmetry, this could lead to a stabilization of the outbreaks, which would have a positive effect on adjacent regions. Asymmetry could be generated in the effective contact rate by mosquito control, which could include reducing mosquito breeding sites (Slosek 1986) , or through new genetic controls which are under development (Barbazan et al. 2008) . Asymmetry in the birth rate could be generated by lowering the effective birth rate through vaccination of new susceptibles once a vaccine is available. However, because the bifurcation point saturates rather than increasing indefinitely as asymmetry increases, such a strategy would be successful only if the epidemic parameters in the real system are moderately close to the bifurcation. (Extreme asymmetry may even be destabilizing, so this strategy works best locally when the asymmetry is not too strong.) Real systems exhibiting oscillatory behavior may already be well into an unstable region of parameters. For such systems, our suggested control strategy may not apply since asymmetry between adjacent regions is already likely, thus reducing that impact that an increase in the asymmetry could have. On the other hand, in the case of dengue fever a recent study (Cummings et al. 2009 ) has highlighted a decreasing trend in both the force of infection and birth and death rates in the population of Thailand during a time span of about 30 years.
