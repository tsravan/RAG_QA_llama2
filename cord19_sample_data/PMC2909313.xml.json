However, viruses can\nemploy complementation, a mechanism whereby low-fitness genotypes can use, to their\nadvantage, intracellular proteins made by coinfecting strains of high fitness.19\u201321 Coinfection combined with\ncomplementation can therefore provide phenotypic buffering in the event of genomic\nmutations, similar to other buffering mechanisms such as gene duplication and diploidy that\nmight be positively selected because they facilitate canalization in higher organisms.22,23 Complementation can buffer against\nnegative fitness effects of deleterious alleles in coinfecting populations of viruses.20 This buffering effect introduces an\necologically determined community-level robustness which renders their individual-level\nrobustness less necessary. This logic infers that the degree of coinfection\u2014high\nmultiplicity of infection (MOI; ratio of viruses to cells) versus low MOI\u2014should influence\nevolution of robustness in virus populations.14 We note that many other phenomena consequential for virus evolution\ncan occur as a result of coinfection, especially genetic exchange (recombination) between\nviruses and selection for virus \u201ccheaters\u201d such as defective-interfering particles.24 For brevity we limit our discussion to\ncomplementation that occurs during coinfection and its potential role in the evolution of\nvirus robustness.",

To examine whether high-MOI\npopulations of phage \u03c66\nwill evolve decreased genetic robustness against mutations, virus populations were first\npropagated for 300 generations under high versus low MOI.25,14 The expectation was that high-MOI evolved viruses would become\nmore brittle, in comparison to their low-MOI evolved counterparts. To reveal this assumed\noutcome, clones were randomly chosen from the treatment populations and used to initiate\nlineages subjected to mutation accumulation via passage through severe bottlenecks\n(population size=1\nindividual); this method allows genetic drift to overwhelm selection, such that virus\nlineages amass mutations that are on average deleterious.26 The mean magnitude and variance in fitness changes that occurred\nbecause of bottlenecking were statistically compared between lineages founded by presumed\nrobust (low-MOI) and brittle (high-MOI) viruses. Results from the mutation accumulation\nanalysis supported the hypothesis that viruses historically evolved under frequent\ncoinfection became relatively less genetically robust than those evolved under rare\ncoinfection.14 One alternative\nexplanation for the observations would be a higher mutation rate in the viruses evolved at\nhigh MOI, causing them to experience a greater number of fixed mutations (and hence, greater\nfitness loss) during the mutation accumulation; however, no evidence suggests that these\nviruses mutate at rates higher than their counterparts evolved at low MOI.14,15 Thus, the study provided the first\nevidence that genetic robustness could evolve to change in biological populations.",

Following this\nmanipulation, each population was mixed (1:1 volumetric) with P.\nphaseolicola bacteria (i.e., \u223c4\u00d7109\ncells) and incubated at 25 \u00b0C\nfor an additional 120 min, sufficient time for at least one virus generation consisting of\ncell attachment/entry, intracellular replication of virus progeny, and cell lysis (death)\nthat bursts the cell to liberate offspring.

In contrast, we observed that all three lineages in the high\ndosage (15 min UVC exposure) treatment went extinct by passage 10 of the experiment (data\nnot shown).

The latter outcome clearly demonstrated an evolutionary\nconstraint for the virus. Last, all of the evolved populations in the low dosage (2.5 min\nUVC exposure) treatment were extant by end of the study.

This outcome is perhaps unlikely given the\nempirical data thus far.43 However,\nfurther data involving a variety of different viruses are warranted, and the results from\nexperimental evolution studies caution that robustness may be positively related to\nevolvability and to competitive superiority in RNA viruses.15",

Environmental robustness of a virus may be defined in terms of\nits host generalization (host range, the number of host types it can productively\ninfect).44 Theory predicts that evolved\ngeneralization may be particularly useful if organisms tend to encounter environments that\nchange unexpectedly.45 That is,\ngeneralists may be favored by selection because they are better predisposed to survive and\ngive rise to successful progeny in the face of variable environments, relative to\nspecialists that possess a narrow niche. This idea may explain why pathogens with a\npre-existing broad host range seem better able to emerge on novel hosts, relative to\nspecialized pathogens.46\u201348 To\ntest this idea directly, we used populations of VSV that evolved differences in host use\nbecause of prior selection in constant versus variable host environments.49,50 The formal prediction was that VSV\npopulations experiencing direct selection for host range would have higher mean growth and\nless variance in mean growth on a collection of challenge hosts, compared to VSV populations\nthat were either relatively specialized or indirectly selected for host range.51 When challenged to grow on four novel hosts\nin vitro, the viruses that had been selected for generalism exhibited\nhigher or equivalent host growth, lower among-population variance in host growth, and lower\nvariance in population growth across hosts. Thus, these three predictions relating to the\nhypothesis were generally supported because direct selection for host breadth more often\nallowed successful emergence. The results suggested that determination of current niche\nbreadth should be further investigated as a potentially useful indicator in predicting\npathogen emergence.51,52",

            "text": "In nonvirus parasites the situation is more complicated, because the process of invasion is\na complex module involving several different effectors. One possible example of a robust\ninvasion module is in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the\nmost deadly form of human malaria. In P. falciparum and the apicomplexan\nparasites, an apical complex is central to the invasion process, which includes multiple\nsteps involving protein interactions and temporally and spatially regulated expression of\nproteases and polymerization machinery.63,66,67 Given the importance of erythrocytes as cells where parasite\nreplication occurs, one might expect that P. falciparum interactions with\nerythrocytes should be particularly critical in a robustness module for the pathogen. In\nfact, studies show that the erythrocyte-attachment process involves redundancy in ligands\nused for binding of the pathogen to erythrocyte receptors.68,62 This evolved strategy might have been selected in\nP. falciparum because erythrocyte receptors are highly polymorphic,\nperhaps among the fastest evolving genes in the human genome.69,70 Research shows that P. falciparum\nutilizes a plethora of ligands to bind erythrocyte receptors.62,68,70 Interestingly, a \u201cmolecular hierarchy\u201d may be\nthe ideal term to describe ligand usage in P. falciparum; the pathogen\u2019s\ninvasion module may consist of a hierarchy whereby some ligands used in attachment are\npreferred over others, with the switch in usage only taking place when a ligand higher up in\nthe hierarchy is ineffective (Fig. 4).68 This observation may be usefully couched in\nterms of robustness, because redundancy is a possible mechanism for constructing a robust\nbiological system. To ensure that an essential function is carried out, a biological system\ncan be organized to contain several alternative pathways in the event that one or more\nbecome unavailable or dysfunctional. This evolved strategy decreases the probability that an\nenvironmental perturbation disrupts performance.",
