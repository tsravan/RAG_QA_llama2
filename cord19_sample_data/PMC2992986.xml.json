            "text": "The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative (TCRI) has been established as a longitudinal prospective investigation of term, non\u2010low birth weight otherwise healthy infants and their biological mothers. The primary goals of the study are: (i) to investigate both the acute and the long\u2010term health consequences of varying severity and aetiology of clinically significant viral respiratory tract infections on the outcomes of allergic rhinitis (AR) and early childhood asthma; and (ii) to identify the potentially modifiable factors that define children who are at greatest risk of developing asthma following infant respiratory viral infection. This study is unique, in that it was designed in parallel with our Tennessee Asthma Bronchiolitis Study (TABS), which is a retrospective birth cohort study of over 95 000 infants and their biological mothers similarly designed to elucidate the factors predisposing to childhood asthma and allergic diseases, but lacking biospecimens. Thus, we designed the prospective TCRI to establish a base for the evaluation of both the risks and benefits of documented significant infant viral respiratory infection of varying severity and aetiology and other environmental exposures on childhood atopy outcomes and to establish a biospecimen repository for analyses including biomarker testing and genotyping. The prospective cohort has the longitudinal design properties that may overcome potential limitations intrinsic to retrospective studies, such as our TABS cohort.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n It is our eventual goal that the findings from these investigations, in conjunction with other investigations that have helped to elucidate genetic and environmental factors associated with asthma development, will help in the identification of primary and secondary prevention strategies for asthma. This report describes the study objectives, design and recruitment results of this study cohort.",

Thus while viral respiratory infections may alter lung physiology and target the inflammatory response to the lower airway, this may only occur during a vulnerable time period during development of the immune system or lung, or in the presence of other risk factors. This developmental component may further reflect important gene\u2013environment interactions that regulate both short\u2010 and long\u2010term airway physiological alterations that manifest themselves clinically as childhood asthma.

First, the study sample was not randomly selected from the general population, but instead was recruited from a single hospital and clinic\u2010based setting, the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital. While Vanderbilt hospitalizations represent greater than 90% of Davidson County/Nashville infant hospitalizations, it represents a smaller proportion of emergency department visits (51%), and likely even fewer paediatric acute care visits.\n2\n The relatively low participation rate among eligible subjects is multifactorial and the result of the long\u2010term nature of the study, the lack of study personnel to enrol all eligible subjects, as well as lower willingness among outpatients to extend their visit in order to participate in the study. While this impacts the demographics and exposures of the study population, and thus generalizibility of our study results, it should not impact the findings of the role of infant viral infection on the outcomes of interest. Next, while airway hyperreactivity is not assessed in making the diagnosis of childhood asthma, the identification of incident asthma cases will take into consideration the positive response to a validated written questionnaire that has been compared with bronchial provocation testing.\n6\n, \n8\n While such an ascertainment strategy might result in the underdiagnosis of asthma, it is unlikely to result in false positive diagnoses during the sixth year of life. Finally, as with many studies, where all eligible participants were approached for participation, difficulty was encountered in follow up of those currently age\u2010eligible for follow up. Strategies to address this include study personnel doing a significant number of follow\u2010up visits at the subject's home, and shipping follow\u2010up materials and requests to paediatricians of subjects who have moved from the region.",
