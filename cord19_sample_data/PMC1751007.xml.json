Many risk factors, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and aspiration, are associated with the development of ARDS. However, other diseases and conditions, such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), adverse reaction to drugs, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), can also cause ARDS; despite similar clinical presentations, etiological diagnosis can be difficult especially for early-stage ARDS. Although the mortality rate of patients with ARDS improves recently [2], the rapid clinical deterioration of such patients, who often progress to multiple organ failure, remains a significant challenge for intensivists in the intensive care unit (ICU). To halt the disease progression of early-stage ARDS, accurate diagnosis is critical.",

This analytical finding resulted from a large number of patients with nonspecific pathological diagnoses undergoing corticosteroid treatment as a rescue or anti-inflammatory therapy after excluding potential active infection, such as the fibroproliferative stage of DAD [16-18], interstitial pneumonitis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, and organizing pneumonia. Early OLB can achieve diagnoses other than fibrosis that are potentially treatable with corticosteroid. Furthermore, the recent study by the ARDS Clinical Trials Network [19] did not support the routine use of methylprednisolone in patients with persistent ARDS (at least seven days after the onset) and suggested that methylprednisolone therapy might be harmful when initiated more than two weeks after the onset of ARDS.

McKenna and colleagues [21] found that for immunocompromised patients, early OLB (average 3.6 days after admission) benefited the histological diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis treated with steroids; however, OLB did not improve clinical outcome for all patients. The overall mortality rate was 51% (21/41) in the present study, which is similar to that obtained in previous reports (range 47 to 50%) [7,8]. More immunocompromised patients were in the survivors group and had a better survival rate than the immunocompetent patients (60% versus 24%; p = 0.0187); the young age and low ALI scores of immunocompromised patients probably accounted in part for their better outcome. Furthermore, the enhanced survival rate of immunocompromised patients might be attributed to more immunocompromised patients (9/13; 69%) than immunocompetent patients (9/17; 53%) receiving high-dose corticosteroid therapy after active infection had been excluded by OLB. Various pulmonary conditions such as infection, disease progression, therapeutic reaction, new and unrelated pathologies, or a combination of these can be present in immunocompromised patients [21,22]. For diagnostic yield and adequate treatment, early OLB has been considered to be a reliable diagnostic modality, providing an early and accurate etiological diagnosis in immunocompromised patients.",

Although operative complications are multifactorial, early OLB in non-stiff lungs (less fibrosis in the present study than in other reports) may account for the low surgical complication rate in this study. Of the 41 patients in the present study, 15 could not be transported to an operating room because they were being administered 100% O2 and a high PEEP; consequently, OLB was performed at the bedside in the ICU. No intra-operative complications or exacerbation of oxygenation and hemodynamics occurred, even in patients with ARDS with severe hypoxemia. Of these 15 patients, four developed postoperative complications of hypotension, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and bronchopleural fistula, respectively. No death was attributable to OLB.

First, because of its retrospective nature our study cannot directly address the question of whether early OLB has a survival benefit. However, understanding of a specific etiology would permit the initiation of specific therapy assuming that such a therapy is available. Many of the diagnoses found in this study (such as metastatic malignancy, infectious pneumonia and hypersensitivity pneumonitis) may have an established positive therapeutic effect on outcome. Second, the result of this study cannot be generally applied to all patients with ARDS. The decision to perform OLB was not made at random and the patients referred for OLB were unlikely to be a representative sample of our ARDS population. This selection bias of patients and intensivists would be expected to increase the possibility of an alternative intervention. A third limitation is that some specific diagnosis such as viral pneumonitis may be underdiagnosed because its identification depends on the availability of laboratory facilities. A standardized comprehensive microbiological examination of BAL before OLB should be established.",
