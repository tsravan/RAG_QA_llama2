            "text": "Intracellular bacterial and viral pathogens have evolved numerous mechanisms to appropriate and exploit different systems of the host during their life cycles in order to facilitate their spread during entry and exit from the host (Cudmore et al., 1997; Finlay and Cossart, 1997; Dramsi and Cossart, 1998). In the case of viruses, perhaps the best studied example is the exploitation of the actin cytoskeleton by vaccinia virus during its exit from infected cells (Cudmore et al., 1997). Vaccinia virus is a large DNA virus with a genome of \u223c191 kb encoding 260 open reading frames (ORFs) that is a close relative of variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox (Johnson et al., 1993; Massung et al., 1993). Vaccinia virus morphogenesis is a complex process which occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells and results in the formation of the intracellular mature virus (IMV) and the intracellular enveloped virus (IEV). IMV consist of a viral core of DNA and protein enveloped in a membrane cisterna derived from the intermediate compartment (Sodeik et al., 1993). The IMV core contains five major proteins, A3L, A4L, A10L, F17R and L4R (Vanslyke and Hruby, 1994; Jensen et al., 1996a), while 12 proteins, A12L, A13L, A14L, A14.5L, A17L, A27L, D8L, G4L, G7L, H3L, I5L and L1R, are associated with the membranes around the virus particle (Jensen et al., 1996a; Betakova et al., 2000). Depending on the virus strain and cell type, a proportion of IMV can become enwrapped by a membrane cisterna derived from the trans-Golgi apparatus to give rise to IEV particles (Schmelz et al., 1994). To date, six IEV-specific proteins, A33R (Roper et al., 1996), A34R (Duncan and Smith, 1992), A36R (Parkinson and Smith, 1994), A56R (Payne and Norrby, 1976; Shida, 1986), B5R (Engelstad et al., 1992; Isaacs et al., 1992) and F13L (Hirt et al., 1986), have been identified. Studies using recombinant viruses have shown that A33R, A34R, B5R and F13L play an important role in IEV assembly (Blasco and Moss, 1991; Engelstad and Smith, 1993; Wolffe et al., 1993, 1997; Roper et al., 1998; Sanderson et al., 1998a; R\u00f6ttger et al., 1999). Vaccinia virus is thought to leave the cell by fusion of the outer IEV membrane with the plasma membrane, to give rise to the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) (Morgan, 1976; Payne, 1980; Blasco and Moss, 1991) or the cell-associated enveloped viruses (CEV) which remain associated with the outer surface of the plasma membrane (Blasco and Moss, 1992).",

            "text": "During the complex vaccinia infection process, the actin cytoskeleton is dramatically reorganized and numerous actin comet-like tails are induced by IEV particles (Cudmore et al., 1995; R\u00f6ttger et al., 1999). Using actin polymerization as the driving force, IEV particles are propelled on actin tails until they contact the plasma membrane and extend outwards, thereby facilitating infection of neighbouring cells (Cudmore et al., 1995). In addition, vaccinia infection results in stimulation of cell motility, loss of contact inhibition and changes in cell adhesion (Sanderson and Smith, 1998; Sanderson et al., 1998b). Vaccinia virus-induced cell motility can be subdivided further into cell migration and extension of neurite-like projections, the latter of which is dependent on microtubules (Sanderson et al., 1998b). The dependence of neurite-like projection formation on microtubules suggests that the microtubule cytoskeleton may also play a role during the life cycle of vaccinia virus. Indeed, recently, the vaccinia A27L protein and microtubules have been shown to be required for efficient IMV dispersion (Sanderson et al., 2000). Furthermore, in the absence of vaccinia actin-based motility, cell to cell spread still occurs although it is less efficient (Wolffe et al., 1997, 1998; Sanderson et al., 1998a), suggesting that additional transport mechanisms must exist.",

In the absence of microtubules, virus particles were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 1B and D). The accumulation of virus particles in the area around the centre of the microtubule aster suggested that a microtubule minus end-directed motor may be involved in establishing the position of the virus in this location. To examine this possibility, we infected cells overexpressing p50/dynamitin which acts as a dominant-negative for dynein\u2013dynactin function (Echeverri et al., 1996). We found in cells overexpressing p50/dynamitin that virus particles did not accumulate at the centre of the microtubule aster but rather throughout the cytoplasm, as occurs in the absence of microtubules (compare Figure 2B with Figure 1D).",

First, in cells infected in the absence of microtubules, the Golgi apparatus as well as vaccinia virus particles are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm but do not co-localize (Figure 3F and O). Secondly, vaccinia particles remain in the vicinity of the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) when the Golgi but not the microtubules was disrupted by treatment with brefeldin A (Figure 3G and P). Similar results were obtained using other markers: A17L for vaccinia, galactosyltransferase for the Golgi or ERGIC53 for the intermediate compartment (data not shown).

From electron microscopic examination of cells infected in the presence of nocodazole, it became clear that IMV particles which are morphologically indistinguishable from controls are formed (Figure 4). Although IMV particles are assembled in the absence of microtubules, we wondered whether their number is reduced and whether those that are formed are infectious, since the integrity of the intermediate compartment depends on microtubules (Burkhardt et al., 1997). To address this question, three independent virus stocks were prepared in the presence or absence of nocodazole. To simplify the interpretation of the data, we used the recombinant vaccinia virus mutant \u0394F13L, which is unable to form IEV (Blasco and Moss, 1991). The final concentration of virus particles produced, as determined by the method of Joklik (1962), was 30.2 \u00b1 5.2 \u00d7 1010 particles/ml in the presence of microtubules and 9.0 \u00b1 6.7 \u00d7 1010 particles/ml in the absence of microtubules. Although there is a 3-fold decrease in the number of virus particles formed in the absence of microtubules, the particles that are formed are infectious (data not shown).",

We did, however, observe IMV particles partially wrapped in trans-Golgi membranes most probably in the process of abortive IEV formation (Figure 4D). Given these data, we examined by indirect immunofluorescence whether low amounts of IEV particles are formed in the absence of microtubules. However, we could find no evidence for co-localization of the IEV protein markers A36R, A34R or A33R with vaccinia particles formed in the presence of nocodazole (Figure 5F). We also found no evidence for IEV formation, based on their ability to nucleate actin tails (Figure 5O). As IEV particle assembly involves wrapping by the Golgi apparatus (Schmelz et al., 1994), we examined the effects of only disrupting this membrane compartment using brefeldin A. We could find no evidence for IEV formation, based on co-localization of IEV protein markers with virus particles and actin tails in cells infected in the presence of brefeldin A (Figure 5G\u2013I and P\u2013R). Indeed, in brefeldin A-treated cells, the IEV membrane proteins required for assembly were observed in the endoplasmic reticulum and not the trans-Golgi (Figure 5H). In summary, our data indicate that the microtubule cytoskeleton is required for efficient IMV assembly and is essential for IEV formation.",

Further analysis showed that during infection the normal morphology of the microtubule cytoskeleton is replaced by morphologically aberrant microtubule forms, which vary among each other but have in common the absence of a discrete MTOC (Figure 7). These aberrant forms can be broadly classified into three types: (i) cells with a disorganized microtubule network where microtubules seem randomly oriented (Figure 7E); (ii) cells in which microtubules form rings around the nucleus and throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 7H); or (iii) cells with long projections consisting of microtubule bundles (Figure 7K). We quantified the appearance of the different morphological forms in five independent infection experiments, in which 200 cells were counted for each time point for each experiment (Figure 7C, F, I and L). Small compact cells, representing 20.7 \u00b1 2.6, 21.8 \u00b1 12.4 and 29.7 \u00b1 15.2% for 5, 8 and 24 h post-infection, respectively, in which the microtubule cytoskeleton morphology was not evident were not included in the analysis. Already by 5 h post-infection, when virus particle assembly has occurred, the normal aster microtubule configuration has been disrupted and replaced in the majority of cells by microtubules without obvious organization from the MTOC (Figure 7F). Furthermore, \u223c10% of cells have microtubule rings and 5% of cells have long projections by this time point (Figure 7I and L).

            "text": "The formation of microtubule bundles and the loss of organization from the MTOC in vaccinia-infected cells is strongly reminiscent of the phenotype observed in cells overexpressing a MAP (Weisshaar et al., 1992; Togel et al., 1998). As overexpression of MAPs stabilizes microtubules, we examined whether the microtubule cytoskeleton in infected cells was more resistant to depolymerization by nocodazole or cold treatment (Figure 8). This was indeed the case, suggesting that the virus genome may encode viral proteins with MAP-like properties. To identify viral proteins which exhibit microtubule-binding properties, we performed microtubule co-sedimentation assays using extracts prepared from uninfected and vaccinia-infected cells (Figure 9). Initial experiments, however, revealed that intact virus particles in the extracts were prone to pellet even in the absence of microtubules, making identification of viral MAPs impossible. To avoid this problem, we prepared extracts from cells infected in the presence of rifampicin, a drug that inhibits vaccinia virus particle assembly but does not affect viral protein expression (Moss et al., 1969; Tan and McAuslan, 1970). The morphological effects of vaccinia infection on the microtubule cytoskeleton were the same in the presence or absence of rifampicin (data not shown). Comparison of the proteins present in pellets from microtubule co-sedimentation assays reveals that a number of additional prominent and minor bands are present in extracts prepared from vaccinia-infected but not from uninfected cells (Figure 9). Co-sedimentation assays performed in the presence of nocodazole or with cold-treated extracts reveal that the majority of these additional bands disappear in the absence of microtubules. To identify the viral proteins co-sedimenting with microtubules, we performed in-gel protease digestion followed by analysis of the resulting peptides by MALDI mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we identified a number of potential vaccinia-encoded MAPs: A10L (a structural protein), I1L and L4R (which are DNA-binding proteins), all of which are associated with viral cores (Vanslyke and Hruby, 1994; Jensen et al., 1996a; Klemperer et al., 1997), and A6L which is conserved in all poxvirus genomes but is of unknown function (Figure 9).",

As a negative control, we also examined the localization of the A3L core protein which was identified as the prominent 70 kDa protein pelleting in the absence of microtubules (Figure 9). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that A10L and L4R are associated with microtubules, in both the presence and absence of rifampicin (Figure 10). As expected, A10L and L4R were also associated with viral particles (data not shown). In contrast, I1L and A3L were never observed in association with microtubules, regardless of the fixation conditions, but were localized to viral factories and viral particles, respectively (data not shown). Interestingly, A10L and L4R were not associated with all microtubules but were co-localized with a subset of acetylated microtubules (Figure 10).",

To examine this possibility, we investigated whether purified viral cores would bind microtubules in vitro. We found that viral cores were able to bind microtubules, while protease-treated cores showed no association (Figure 11A and B). Pre-incubation of purified viral cores with antibodies against A10L and L4R specifically inhibited the interaction of viral cores with microtubules (Figure 11C and D); in contrast, IgG or antibodies against A3L had no inhibitory effect (Figure 11E and F). Taken together, our data suggest that A10L and L4R have MAP-like properties and may play a role in mediating interactions of incoming viral cores with microtubules.",

Furthermore, the loss of microtubule organization precedes detectable association of A10L and L4R with microtubules, which occurs from \u223c8 h post-infection. We therefore wondered whether vaccinia infection disrupts centrosome function, given the loss of microtubule aster configuration during infection (Figure 7). Since microtubules are nucleated by the centrosome in animal cells, we examined whether vaccinia infection affects \u03b3-tubulin, which is critically required for this process (Stearns and Kirschner, 1994). We observed that \u03b3-tubulin labelling of the centrosome is greatly reduced from as early as 2 h post-infection (Figure 12). The same result was obtained when we infected PtK1 cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled \u03b3-tubulin (Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999). In addition, the centrosomal and centriolar components pericentrin, C-Nap 1, Nek 2 and centrin are reduced by immunofluorescence in the centrosomes/centrioles of vaccinia-infected cells (Figure 12). Furthermore, the reduction of centrosomal markers requires viral protein synthesis as their levels are not affected when cells are infected in the presence of cycloheximide (data not shown).",

(1995) that microtubules are required to maintain the integrity of the Golgi apparatus which is in turn required for IMV wrapping to form IEV (Schmelz et al., 1994). In contrast, IMV are assembled in the absence of microtubules, albeit at reduced levels. While microtubules are not required for IMV assembly, they are required together with the dynein\u2013dynactin complex for virion accumulation in the vicinity of the microtubule aster. One can envisage that minus end-directed microtubule-dependent movements of IMV particles from their site of assembly in the viral factory towards the MTOC, by the dynein\u2013dynactin complex, would enhance the possibility of wrapping with the Golgi apparatus and subsequent IEV formation. Recently it has been shown that the IMV protein A27L and microtubules are required for efficient IMV dispersion from the viral factories (Sanderson et al., 2000). In the absence of A27L, mature IMV particles accumulate at the periphery of the virus factory but do not subsequently wrap to form IEV, presumably because they are unable to move on microtubules (Sanderson et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The microtubule- and dynein\u2013dynactin-dependent accumulation of vaccinia in the vicinity of the MTOC is analogous to the microtubule-dependent movements required for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and adenovirus to reach their site of replication in the nucleus (Sodeik et al., 1997; Suomalainen et al., 1999; Leopold et al., 2000). In the case of HSV-1, the UL34 protein, which is associated with the incoming nucleocapsids, interacts with the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein (IC-1a) (Ye et al., 2000). It has also been reported that incoming nucleocapsids of pseudorabies virus, an alphaherpes virus closely related to HSV-1, are associated with and dependent on microtubules for their movement to the nucleus (Kaelin et al., 2000). This interaction may be mediated by the UL25 protein, a minor but essential component of the capsid, which co-localizes with microtubules and accumulates at the MTOC (Kaelin et al., 2000). The accumulation of UL25 at the MTOC is consistent with a possible interaction with the dynein\u2013dynactin motor complex which is known to be localized at the MTOC (Echeverri et al., 1996). It would not be surprising, based on observations with HSV-1 and pseudorabies, if microtubules and dynein\u2013dynactin were also involved in establishing the infection cycle of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein\u2013Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus, all of which are herpes viruses. The other clear example of microtubule-dependent virus movements during the establishment of infection is that of incoming human foamy virus (HFV) which is dependent on microtubules and presumably a minus end-directed microtubule motor to get to its nuclear replication site (Saib et al., 1997). In the absence of protein expression, HFV Gag proteins, which are associated with the viral genome, accumulate at the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent fashion prior to nuclear import (Saib et al., 1997). The centrosomal accumulation of Gag proteins of HFV, however, appears to be unique for this class of retroviruses as no similar localization has been reported for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other retroviruses. On the other hand, the Gag protein of murine leukaemia virus and HIV has been shown to interact with KIF4, a microtubule plus end-directed kinesin motor, both in vitro and in vivo (Kim et al., 1998; Tang et al., 1999), suggesting that additional roles may exist for microtubules and motors during the outward movement of virus particles. Indeed, vaccinia virus particles are able to reach the cell periphery in the absence of actin-based motility (see images in Wolffe et al., 1997; Sanderson et al., 1998a, 2000; R\u00f6ttger et al., 1999), suggesting that viral particles can also move out on microtubules (Sanderson et al., 2000). Microtubule-dependent motor-driven movements of virus particles represent an efficient mechanism to achieve a peri-nuclear localization, required to facilitate entry into the nucleus during establishment of infection. They also provide an excellent way for newly assembled virus particles to reach the cell periphery, facilitating the continued spread of infection.",

Interestingly, HSV-1 and CMV have also been reported to disrupt the microtubule cytoskeleton and Golgi organization in their infection cycles (Avitabile et al., 1995; Fish et al., 1996). While disruption of the microtubule network might at first sight not appear to be beneficial to the virus, it may not actually hinder viral spread but could enhance it. First, extensive virus assembly and spread to the cell periphery have already occurred by the time the microtubule cytoskeleton and Golgi organization are disrupted. Secondly, disruption of microtubule organization may overcome potential microtubule motor anchoring effects at the MTOC, thus allowing viral spread to the periphery to occur more easily. Lastly, the formation of long projections of up to 200 \u00b5m supported by extensive microtubule bundles provides a means to achieve long range spread of virus particles (Sanderson et al., 1998b).",

The same may also be true for HSV-1, although disruption of centrosome function remains to be established, as late in infection microtubules are organized in bundles around the nucleus and do not show MTOC-orchestrated organization (Avitabile et al., 1995). The identification of viral proteins with MAP-like properties is not unique to vaccinia virus. The VP22 tegument protein from HSV-1 co-localizes with microtubules in infected cells and induces microtubule bundles when expressed in uninfected cells (Elliott and O\u2019Hare, 1998). Other examples of viral MAPs based on their in vivo localization or in vitro association with microtubules are the N protein from murine coronavirus (Kalicharran and Dales, 1996), the movement protein from tobamovirus (Heinlein et al., 1995), the aphid transmission factor from cauliflower mosaic virus (Blanc et al., 1996), the UL25 protein from pseudorabies virus (Kaelin et al., 2000), the VP4 spike protein from rotavirus (Nejmeddine et al., 2000) and the M protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Melki et al., 1994). The identification of A10L and L4R, two viral core proteins, as MAP-like proteins was, however, unexpected given their previously characterized role in viral morphogenesis (Vanslyke and Hruby, 1994). The interaction of A10L and L4R with microtubules in vivo, together with the in vitro microtubule-binding data, suggest a potential mechanism for the association of viral cores with microtubules. One could envisage that viral cores which are released into the cytoplasm at the beginning of infection (Ichihashi, 1996; Vanderpasschen et al., 1998; Pedersen et al., 2000) bind directly to microtubules in a manner analogous to adenovirus or HSV-1 nucleocapsids. Further work is required to determine whether incoming cores do in fact move towards the MTOC by the dynein\u2013dynactin complex and/or use the complex for anchoring on microtubules.",

Indeed, the loss of microtubule organization from the MTOC precedes detectable association of A10L and L4R with microtubules, which occurs from \u223c8 h post-infection. Vaccinia-induced loss of centrosomal proteins is inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that viral protein expression is required for disruption of the centrosome microtubule nucleation activity. To our knowledge, vaccinia virus infection represents the first example of virus-induced disruption of centrosome function, although we would predict that HSV-1 may have a similar effect. The mechanism by which vaccinia virus disrupts the centrosome requires further study; nevertheless, it is clear that understanding the molecular basis of this disruption will provide important insights into the regulation and stability of centrosome function which currently is the subject of intense research (Ohta et al., 1993; Lane and Nigg, 1997; Karsenti, 1999).",
