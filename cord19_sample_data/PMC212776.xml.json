It is required that this analysis be done in close to real time. This design objective is complex and difficult to operationalize because of the large number of organisms and the even larger number of possible routes of dissemination all requiring potentially different types of data for their detection, different algorithms, and different time urgencies. For this reason, our focus since beginning the project in 1999 has been on the specific problem of detecting a large-scale outbreak due to an outdoor (outside buildings) aerosol release of anthrax. Additional design objectives were adherence to NEDSS standards to ensure future interoperability with other types of public health surveillance systems, scalability, and that the system could not rely on manual data entry, except when it was done in a focused way in response to the system's own analysis of passively collected data.",

When a patient arrives at an ED (or an InstaCare in Utah), the registration clerk or triage nurse elicits the patient's reason for visit (i.e., the chief complaint), age, gender, home zip code, and other data and enter the data in a registration computer. The registration computer then generates an HL7 ADT (admission, discharge, and transfer) message and transmits it to the health system's HL7 message router (also called an integration engine). There usually is only one message router per health system even if there are many hospitals and facilities. These processes are all routine existing business activities and do not need to be created de novo for public health surveillance.",

The RODS HL7 listener maintains the connection with the health system's message router and parses the HL7 message as described in more detail below. It then passes the chief complaint portion of the message to a Bayesian text classifier that assigns each free-text chief complaint to one of seven syndromic categories (or to an eighth category, other). The database stores the category data, which then are used by applications such as detection algorithms and user interfaces.  ",

Although data in this project are de-identified, certain information such as the number of ED visits by zip code were considered proprietary information by some health systems. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) concerns also were very prominent in the discussions. Data-sharing agreements were executed with every participating health system that addressed these concerns. As an additional precaution, all RODS project members meet annually with University of Pittsburgh council to review obligations and are required to sign an agreement every year stating that they understand the terms of the data-sharing agreements and agree to abide by the terms.

This feature requires a token that can be passed to a hospital information system that can uniquely identify a patient, and the reason we have prototyped this feature in the HSRC and not in RODS is simply that HSRC runs within the firewall so an unencrypted token can be used. The look-back is accomplished as follows: when a public health user identifies an anonymous patient record of interest (e.g., one of 20 patients with diarrhea today from one zip code), HSRC calls the UPMC Health System Web-based electronic medical record system and passes it the patient identifier. UPMC Health System then requests the user to log in using the UPMC-issued password before providing access to the record directly from its own secure Web site. This approach is not intended to be implemented in HSRC, but rather in the RODS system outside of the firewall of a health system. It is intended to use encrypted identifiers that the health system would decrypt to retrieve the correct record. The HSRC could provide the encryption-decryption service or it could be provided by another data system in the hospital. We estimate that the prevalence of health systems that have Web-based results review in the United States is 30% to 50% and growing so that this approach could very quickly improve the efficiency of outbreak investigations.
