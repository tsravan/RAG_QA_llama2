Drug abuse causes many problems both to individuals and to societies, including loss of productivity, transmission of infectious diseases, crime, family and social disorder, and excessive health care expenditures [1]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, associated with injection drug use (IDU) and needle sharing to a large extent, has become one of most stunning tragedies in human history. It has caused more than 20 million deaths, and about 40 million people are living with HIV worldwide thus far, with Africa as the most afflicted continent [2]. As the most populous country in the world, China has also observed rapidly increasing drug abuse and HIV/AIDS occurrence in the past 10 to 20 years. China can still shape the course of its epidemic, but it needs to move swiftly and with great resolve [2].",

We searched English and Chinese language literature via Medline and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and reviewed unpublished official data, including national reports on illicit drug control and HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance data. More than 100 papers and reports were reviewed.

After a short nationwide anti-drug campaign, drug abuse was reported to be eliminated from the mainland in the early 1950s, and for the next three decades China was believed to be a drug-free nation [3].",

In Asia, there are two major opiate-producing regions: the \"Golden Triangle,\" comprising three Southeast Asian countries of Myanmar (Burma), Laos and Thailand, and the \"Golden Crescent\" that includes the three Southwest Asian nations of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan [4,5]. The majority of heroin and opium in the current Chinese market is brought from Myanmar into Yunnan Province or from Viet Nam into Guangxi Province, and then it is trans-shipped along inland trafficking routes to Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu and Xinjiang or to Guangdong, Shanghai and Beijing [6-8]. A small potion of heroin/opium is trafficked into Xinjiang from the \"Golden Crescent\" [8]. These drugs further penetrate into other provinces. Since the late 1990s, increasing amounts of amphetamine-type-stimulants (ATS) and other chemically related synthetic drugs including amphetamine, methamphetamine and ecstasy have been locally manufactured and consumed in China [4].",

Since the early 1990s, more and more urban residents use illicit drugs. The majority of drug abusers are young people with a low education level and limited job skills, although a small proportion of urban users regard using drugs as an indicator of \"high social class.\" NNCC data showed that 74% were aged 17\u201335 years in 2002 [12].",

            "text": "Experimentation (90%), peer pressure (44%), and relaxation (42%) are commonly cited reasons for beginning to use drugs. Initially, drugs were taken primarily through sniffing/snorting (55%) or smoking cigarettes mixed with drugs (38%) [13]. Injection of drugs became increasingly common among drug users, probably as a result of increasing prices of illicit drugs and greater cost effectiveness of injecting to achieve the desired effect. National behavioral surveillance data showed that the median prevalence of IDU among drug users increased from 35% in April 1995 to 49% in April 2004, and median prevalence of needle sharing among IDUs also increased from 26% to 43% during this period [14,15]. \"Buying from drug or grocery stores\" and \"buying from hospitals\" were the two most common routes for obtaining injection needles and syringes [16]. Reasons for sharing a needle included: \"do not care about anything else when hooked,\" \"thought it had been cleaned up,\" \"difficult to buy or obtain,\" \"only sharing with selected persons,\" \"no money to buy,\" and \"following other drug users\" [16]. Besides IDU and needle sharing, other risk behaviors including unprotected commercial sex put drug users and ultimately non drug users at high risk of HIV [17,18]. It is believed that many female drug users sell sex for drugs, and limited published research also provides supporting evidence [18-20]. However, the impact of the interaction between IDU and commercial sex on HIV risk is not clear. Considering the dramatic increase in the commercial sex industry in China, and the potential bridging role of those with dual risk behaviors in transmitting HIV from high risk groups to the general population, research on the interaction of IDU and commercial sex should be given high priority.",

By 1997, 3 out of 22 sites detected positives, and the average prevalence increased to 6.6%. After that, national average HIV prevalence among IDUs varied between 5.4% and 8.2% [15,22]. However, dramatic geographic differences in HIV prevalence have been observed. Yunnan and Xinjiang provinces have the most severe HIV infection rates among IDUs. Other provinces along or close to drug trafficking roads, such as Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi, have moderate epidemics [25]. HIV began to spread rapidly in Yunnan province in the late 1980s and early 1990s [26]. High prevalence among IDUs was first detected in 1998 in Urumqi City (28.8%) and in Yining City (82.2%) of Xinjiang Province and later on in selected sentinel sites for IDU in other provinces [27]. These include Guangxi (>10%, 1998 sentinel data), Jiangxi (14.5%, 2000), Sichuan (16\u201320%, 2002), Guizhou (17\u201319%, 2002), and Hunan (15\u201320%, 2003) [23]. In 2004, 75% of HIV national sentinel sites for IDU detected HIV infection. More than 20% of HIV prevalence was reported in selected sites in Xinjiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi and Hunan [22]. Official HIV prevalence rates in other geographic areas remain <10%; these reports may reflect reality or may be due to failure in detection.",

The measures targeting the root include continuously cracking down on drug smuggling activities and discouraging new users through anti-drug education campaigns. The Chinese government actively seeks to collaborate with neighboring countries to prevent drug smuggling across borders and to help Myanmar, for example, to reduce opium poppy cultivation by replacing with crop plantation. Chinese mass media have increased anti-drug education to the general population. Anti-drug education has been included in the curricula for primary and secondary school students [9]. The measures targeting the surface include providing drug detoxification and harm reduction services to drug users. China has about 300 voluntary detoxification clinics, 700 CRC, and 200 RELC. Each can accommodate 100 to 3,000 patients [9]. Both western medications and traditional Chinese medicines are used for detoxification, and community therapy has been provided in some heavily affected areas since the late 1990s [9]. The National Working Group for Community-based Methadone Maintenance Therapy was established collectively by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Food and Drug Administration. Guidelines for methadone maintenance therapy and needle exchange programs were enacted in early 2004. By the end of 2004, there were 34 methadone substitution therapy clinics and 90 clean needle exchange service points across the country [35,36]. The methadone program will be expanded to about 1,000 sites and treat 200,000 drug users over the next 5 years [35].",

Harm reduction seems to encourage tolerance of social phenomena that are undesirable and hazardous and that may result in social turpitude. Instead, abstinence is considered to be the proper way to address drug problems [39]. In the United States, law and policy restrict the use of federal funds in supporting needle and injection equipment distribution projects. However, many studies refute the concern that access to sterile syringes is an endorsement of IDU and is likely to result in increases in injection and initiation of injection [41,42]. Harm reduction projects in China are in the pilot phases. Some scholars and health officials still have similar concerns as in some Western countries. They believe that needle exchange services may send a wrong signal of encouraging drug abuse to drug users and the public, and they consider methadone substitution unethical because it uses one drug to replace another drug [43]. As drug use and HIV/AIDS spread rapidly across the country, it is urgent to find supporting domestic evidence that harm reduction will reduce HIV transmission by evaluating harm reduction projects and ultimately scaling up harm reduction efforts.",

Greater retention in treatment has been found to result in greater decreases in drug use, criminal activity, and unemployment [46]. The length of drug treatment has a positive association with better post-treatment outcome [46]. However, limited experience with methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in China shows a high rate of dropouts. International studies have shown that motivational enhancement therapy or motivational interviewing enhances treatment initiation, retention and outcomes in MMT program [47,48], and adding behavioral intervention components into MMT programs increases abstinence and reduces HIV risk behaviors [49]. Policy-oriented operational research is needed in China to better understand how to increase the effectiveness of MMT and other harm reduction interventions in the Chinese context.",

            "text": "There are still persistent conflicts in the policy and legal landscape. The central government has given explicit support to harm reduction, for example, as stated in the Medium- and Long-Term Strategic Plan and the Action Plan. Some programs have been implemented successfully [36,50,51]. However, in China, as in many other countries, public health and public security authorities frequently approach drug abuse from different perspectives, leading to conflicting approaches at local levels. The crackdown philosophy and detention of drug users in China reflect inconsistent interpretations of \"harm reduction\" and present a challenge to public health officials in implementing methadone substitution and needle-exchange programs [52]. Drug users may be reluctant to participate in these programs due to fear of being caught by police officers [50]. It might be impossible to completely solve the dilemma in the near future, but this conflict is expected to gradually reduce for the following reasons. First, Chinese national policies for HIV prevention and control have become much more pragmatic in the past years. MMT and needle exchange programs were almost unimaginable several years ago, but now they are ready to be expanded across the country. We expect that the open policy trend will continue as the Chinese economy is increasingly merged with international markets, and this trend will favor harm reduction programs. Furthermore, China's centralized government may achieve an advantage in promoting public health policies if these policies are believed to be correct. Second, inter-agency coordination on public health crisis has been enhanced at both central and local governmental levels since SARS outbreak in 2003, which reduces potential conflict of public health policies. Public health workers should provide policy advocacy to public security authorities and help them change their traditional norms about illicit drug control and obtain their supports for harm reduction. Third, operational research is needed to provide evidence on the benefits of harm reduction programs and convince policy enforcers and lead to revision of unfavorable policy components.",

            "text": "HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) is often considered the first step for initiating prevention and/or therapy. One of the strategies for addressing the AIDS epidemic is to give people an opportunity to know their HIV status so that they can take precautions to avoid further spread and receive early therapy if they are infected [53,54]. However, even in developed countries, many at-risk people do not take VCT. A national British survey in 2000 showed that only one-third of IDUs had VCT in the past 5 years [55]. About one-fourth of the 0.8 to 0.9 million infected people in the United States remain unaware that they are HIV positive [54]. In China, there is a large discrepancy between reported (about 100,000) and estimated (about 1 million) cumulative HIV/AIDS cases thus far. Many at-risk individuals do not seek out standard HIV counseling and testing services. The stigma associated with drug use and HIV/AIDS and fear of arrest or knowing a positive result can be major barriers to access to VCT. A survey among 840 pregnant women and 780 health professionals in Yunnan Province \u2013 an epicenter of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China \u2013 found prevalent negative attitudes toward HIV/AIDS. Twenty-three percent of health professionals and 45% of pregnant women thought HIV was a disease of \"low class and illegal\" people; 48% of health professionals and 59% of pregnant women thought that HIV positive individuals should not be allowed to get married; and 30% of the health professionals were not willing to treat an HIV-positive individual [56]. Cost of traditional VCT, low awareness of risk factors for HIV infection, distance, and inconvenience in time also may prevent access to VCT. Possible solutions include development of outreach programs to offer anonymous testing and counseling to those at heightened risk of HIV infection and adoption of new technologies such as rapid saliva testing and counseling strategies to improve the outreach and efficacy of programs.",

A recent survey of 29 NGOs in Central and Eastern Europe showed that most NGOs targeted injection drug users; provided needle exchange and HIV prevention peer education; and delivered AIDS presentations and distributed educational materials [57]. In Africa, where the main transmission occurs via heterosexual activity, NGOs are most likely to direct their attention to the general public and to youth; they provide peer-education or community outreach [58]. In both Thailand and Brazil, where success has been observed in controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic or reducing AIDS mortality, NGO are believed to play a key role, but their programs lack rigorous and systemic evaluation [59,60]. NGOs often face several difficulties: lack of financial resources [57,58]; lack of communications with governmental organizations [61]; governmental indifference or opposition; and AIDS-related stigma [57].",
