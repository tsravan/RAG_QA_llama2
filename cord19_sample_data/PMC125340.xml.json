            "text": "The genetic information of RNA viruses is organized very efficiently. Practically every nucleotide of their genome is utilized, either as protein-coding sequence or as cis-acting signals for translation, RNA synthesis or RNA encapsidation. As part of their genome expression strategy, several groups of positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses produce subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (reviewed by Miller and Koev, 2000). The replication of their genomic RNA, which is also the mRNA for the viral replicase, is supplemented with the generation of sg transcripts to express structural and auxiliary proteins, which are encoded downstream of the replicase gene in the genome. Sg mRNAs of +RNA viruses are always 3\u2032-co-terminal with the genomic RNA, but different mechanisms are used for their synthesis. Some viruses, such as brome mosaic virus, initiate sg mRNA synthesis internally on the full-length minus strand RNA template (Miller et al., 1985). Others, exemplified by red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), may rely on premature termination of minus strand synthesis from the genomic RNA template, followed by the synthesis of sg plus strands from the truncated minus strand template (Sit et al., 1998). Members of the order Nidovirales, which includes coronaviruses and arteriviruses, have evolved a third and unique mechanism, which employs discontinuous RNA synthesis for the generation of an extensive set of sg RNAs (reviewed by Brian and Spaan, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). Nidovirus sg mRNAs differ fundamentally from other viral sg RNAs in that they are not only 3\u2032-co-terminal, but also 5\u2032-co-terminal with the genome (Figure 1A). A 5\u2032 common leader sequence of 65\u2013221 nucleotides, derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA, is attached to the 3\u2032 part of each sg RNA (the \u2018mRNA body\u2019).",

            "text": "Various models have been put forward to explain the co-transcriptional fusion of non-contiguous parts of the nidovirus genome during sg RNA synthesis (Figure 1B and C). Central to each of these models are short transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present both at the 3\u2032 end of the leader and at the 5\u2032 end of the sg RNA body regions in the genomic RNA. The TRS is copied into the mRNA and connects its leader and body part (Spaan et al., 1983; Lai et al., 1984). Synthesis of sg mRNAs initially was proposed to be primed by free leader transcripts, which would base-pair to the complementary TRS regions in the full-length minus strand, and would be extended subsequently to make sg plus strands (Figure 1B; Baric et al., 1983, 1985). This model, however, was based on the report that sg minus strands were not present in coronavirus-infected cells (Lai et al., 1982). The subsequent discovery of such molecules (Sethna et al., 1989) resulted in reconsideration of the initial \u2018leader-primed transcription\u2019 model. Sawicki and Sawicki (1995) have proposed an alternative model (Figure 1C), in which the discontinuous step occurs during minus instead of plus strand RNA synthesis. In this model, minus strand synthesis would be attenuated after copying a body TRS from the plus strand template. Next, the nascent minus strand, with the TRS complement at its 3\u2032 end, would be transferred to the leader TRS and attach by means of TRS\u2013TRS base pairing. RNA synthesis would be reinitiated to complete the sg minus strand by adding the complement of the genomic leader sequence. Subse quently, the sg minus strand would be used as template for sg mRNA synthesis, and the presence of the leader complement at its 3\u2032 end might allow the use of the same RNA signals that direct genome synthesis from the full-length minus strand.",

However, base pairing is only one step of the nascent strand transfer process and is essential in both models outlined in Figure 1. The EAV genomic RNA contains several sequences that match the leader TRS precisely, but nevertheless are not used for sg RNA synthesis (den Boon et al., 1996; Pasternak et al., 2000). This suggests that leader\u2013body TRS similarity alone is, though necessary, not sufficient for the strand transfer to occur.",

Every nucleotide of the TRS (5\u2032-UCAACU-3\u2032) was substituted with each of the three alternative nucleotides. Our analysis revealed a number of striking similarities with the process of copy-choice RNA recombination, as it occurs in RNA viruses. Whereas the leader TRS plays only a targeting role in translocation of the nascent strand, body TRS nucleotides appear to fulfil diverse position-specific and base-specific functions. In addition, the sequence of the leader\u2013body junctions of the sg mRNAs produced by these mutants provided strong evidence for the discontinuous minus strand extension model.",

Following transfection of the RNA into baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, intracellular RNA is isolated and analysed by northern blot hybridization and RT\u2013PCR (van Marle et al., 1999a). Due to differences in transfection efficiency, the total amount of virus-specific RNA (genomic RNA and sg mRNA) isolated from transfected cell cultures is somewhat variable. Thus, the accurate quantitation of sg mRNA synthesis by TRS mutants requires an internal standard for transfection efficiency. The amount of viral genomic RNA can be this standard, but only if its amplification is not dramatically affected by the TRS mutations. To prove that this is the case, we used the previously described mutants L4, B4 and LB4 (van Marle et al., 1999a), in which five nucleotides of the TRS (5\u2032-UCAAC-3\u2032) were replaced by the sequence 5\u2032-AGUUG-3\u2032, either in the leader TRS (L4), RNA7 body TRS (B4) or both TRSs (LB4).",

Prior to RNA analysis, the amount of isolated intracellular RNA was corrected for the transfection efficiency of the sample, so that each lane in Figure 2 represents EAV-specific RNA from an approximately equal number of EAV-positive cells. Phosphoimager quantitation revealed that genomic RNA replication of mutants L4, B4 and LB4 varied by not more than 30% (Table I). These differences could reflect, for example, a slight influence of RNA secondary structure changes in the TRS regions on genomic RNA synthesis. Remarkably, however, the genomic RNA level of the leader\u2013body TRS double mutant LB4 was not affected by more than 10%. In view of the results obtained with these pentanucleotide TRS mutants, we assumed that the amount of genomic RNA could indeed be used as an internal standard during the analysis of mutants containing only single nucleotide replacements in leader TRS and/or RNA7 body TRS.",

In that study, the role of TRS nucleotides C2 and C5 was tested by substituting them with G. It was concluded that base pairing between the sense leader TRS and the antisense body TRS plays a crucial role in nidovirus sg RNA synthesis. We now took a more systematic approach and performed an extensive site-directed co-variation mutagenesis study of the entire leader TRS and RNA7 body TRS, which directs the synthesis of the most abundant EAV sg RNA. Every nucleotide of the TRS (5\u2032-UCA ACU-3\u2032) was replaced with each of the other possible nucleotides. As in the study of van Marle et al. (1999a), every mutation was introduced into leader TRS, RNA7 body TRS and both TRSs, resulting in 54 mutant constructs. Each mutant was given a unique name: e.g. BU1A refers to a mutant in which a U has been changed to A at position 1 of the body TRS; LU1A refers to the same substitution in the leader TRS; and DU1A means that these two substitutions were combined in one double mutant construct. The amount of sg RNA7 was quantitated by phosphoimager scanning of hybridized gels and was corrected for the amount of genomic RNA in the same lane (as outlined above). Figure 3 shows the relative sg RNA7 level of the 54 mutants, compared with the RNA7 level of the wild-type control. For a selection of 11 interesting mutants (see below), the analysis was repeated three times (Figure 4), without observing significant variations in sg RNA synthesis.",

Remarkably, the effects of single (leader or body) TRS mutations were mostly base specific, i.e. different nucleotide substitutions at the same position affected sg RNA7 synthesis to different extents. For example, at position 1, the BU1A mutant retained 44% of the wild-type RNA7 synthesis level, whereas both the BU1C and BU1G mutants lost RNA7 synthesis almost completely. Conversely, when U1 of the leader TRS was changed to A or G, RNA7 synthesis was completely abolished, whereas 13% of the wild-type level was still maintained by LU1C. For position 2, only the BC2U mutant retained 30% of the wild-type RNA7 synthesis level, while all the other position 2 single mutants have lost 90% or more of wild-type RNA7 synthesis. Another example is position 6: BU6C left only 5% of wild-type RNA7 synthesis, whereas BU6A produced much higher RNA7 levels. This implied that for some positions (1, 2 and 6), certain mismatches in the duplex between plus leader TRS and minus body TRS, such as U\u2013U (BU1A and BU6A) or C\u2013A (LU1C and BC2U), are allowed to a limited extent. In contrast, no mismatches were allowed for position 5, where all single nucleotide substitutions abolished RNA7 synthesis almost completely.",

On the other hand, for positions 3 and 4, G\u2013U base pairing was shown to be functional, because mutants LA3G and LA4G, which can form G\u2013U base pairs between the G in the plus leader TRS and U in the minus body TRS, were the only position 3 and 4 single mutants that produced reasonable levels of RNA7. Taken together, these findings suggest that other factors, besides leader\u2013 body base pairing, also play a role in sg RNA synthesis and that the primary sequence (or secondary structure) of TRSs may dictate strong base preferences at certain positions. Our analysis of the degree of complementation by the double mutants provided strong support for this assumption.",

In the other double mutants (all position 1, 3 and 4 mutants, and DU6C), in clear contradiction to the predictions of the \u2018base pairing model\u2019, RNA7 synthesis was not significantly restored. Moreover, a comparison of the values for the B and D mutants in Figure 3 showed that, for almost all of these mutants (e.g. the position 1 mutants), the amount of sg RNA7 produced by the double mutant appeared to be limited by the level allowed by the body TRS mutation. Sometimes the RNA7 level of the double mutant was even less than that of the leader mutant (DU1C, DA3G, DA4G or DU6C). Clearly, for these substitutions, restoration of the possibilities for leader\u2013body duplex formation did not restore sg RNA synthesis.

The fact that single leader TRS mutations at all six positions severely repressed RNA7 synthesis indicated that base pairing of every TRS nucleotide contributes to sg RNA production.

Due to the restoration of TRS base pairing possibilities, the RNA7 synthesis of double mutant DU1A was significantly increased compared with that of LU1A, but not above the level of BU1A. Thus, restoration of the leader\u2013body duplex in DU1A exerted a clear effect on sg RNA7 production compared with LU1A, but had no effect on sg RNA synthesis compared with BU1A.

To interpret these base preferences accurately, it is necessary to limit the analysis to the double mutants only, because in these mutants the down-regulation of sg RNA synthesis was only due to the sequence changes in the body TRS, and not to the disruption of the leader\u2013body TRS duplex. There were strict preferences for positions 1, 3 and 4 of the body TRS: at position 1, only the U to A substitution allowed for a significant RNA7 level (\u223c40% of wild-type); and at positions 3 and 4, only the A to U mutants retained 15\u201320% of the wild-type level. For positions 2 and 5, the sequence constraints were less stringent (all substitutions allowed for >20% of wild-type level), but still only DC2A and DC2U reached >50%. At position 6 of the body TRS, only U to C was not allowed, whereas the other two double mutants still produced 50% or more of RNA7. In other words, the functional EAV RNA7 body TRS (based on the analysis of our single nucleotide substitutions) can be described as U1(C/u/a)2A3A4C5(U/a/g)6, with wild-type nucleotides shown in upper case and nucleotides that allowed for at least 50% of the wild-type RNA7 level shown in lower case. Remarkably, TRS nucleotides A3, A4 and C5 are conserved in the TRSs of all other arteriviruses (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). Also the fact that DC2U retained 80% of RNA7 synthesis corresponded nicely to the presence of a U at this position in other arteriviruses.",

This model predicts that the TRS-derived sequence that forms the leader\u2013body junction in the sg mRNA is a copy of the body TRS, and not of the leader TRS. The leader-primed transcription model predicts the opposite (Figure 1B). Therefore, determining the origin of the leader\u2013body junction of sg mRNAs would help to distinguish between the two models. However, in the wild-type situation, EAV leader and body TRSs are identical and consequently one cannot determine the origin of the sg mRNA leader\u2013body junction. This problem could be overcome by tracing the mutations introduced in leader or RNA7 body TRS mutants, most of which retained part of their ability to produce mRNA7. In a previous study (van Marle et al., 1999a), we found that nucleotides 2 and 5 of the mRNA7 leader\u2013body junction sequence were derived exclusively from the body TRS, and not from the leader TRS. This was shown by direct sequencing of RT\u2013PCR products obtained from the residual mRNA7 produced by mutants BC2G, LC2G, BC5G and LC5G (van Marle et al., 1999a).",

The most striking result was that mRNA7 of mutants BU1A, BU1G and LU1C contained exclusively the body TRS-derived nucleotide at position +1. Thus, for these mutants, the crossover site could be mapped precisely between TRS nucleotide positions \u20131 and +1, meaning that the complete leader\u2013 body junction sequence in an EAV sg mRNA can be body TRS derived. On the other hand, sg RNAs from mutants LU1A, BU1C and LU1G contained mixed populations of leader TRS- and body TRS-derived nucleotides at position +1 (Figure 5): A and U for LU1A, C and U for BU1C, and G and U for LU1G. Remarkably, this pattern correlated with the relative amounts of sg mRNA7 produced by these mutants (Figure 3). Mutants that produced populations of sg RNAs that were mixed with respect to the origin of the nucleotide at position +1 of the leader\u2013body junction had lost RNA7 synthesis almost completely. On the other hand, mutants that contained exclusively the body nucleotide at position +1 retained higher levels of RNA7 synthesis. This observation may be explained as follows: in the wild-type situation, the large majority of the crossovers probably occur between positions \u20131 and +1, leading to a body TRS-derived nucleotide at position +1 in the sg RNA; however, a low number of crossovers take place between nucleotides +1 and +2, resulting in a leader TRS-derived nucleotide at position +1. Mutants in which almost all sg RNA synthesis is blocked by a substitution at position +1 may somehow be deficient in the crossover between \u20131 and +1, but may have retained the ability for crossovers between +1 and +2, which were detected by sequence analysis. Conversely, in position +1 mutants that retain reasonable sg RNA synthesis, most crossovers occur between positions \u20131 and +1, and they obscure the minority of crossovers between +1 and +2 in the sequencing electropherogram. Alternatively, position +1 TRS mutations that strongly interfere with sg RNA synthesis may force a shift of the crossover site in the remaining molecules.",

To explain the presence of a complete copy of the body TRS in the sg mRNA in this model, one would have to assume that a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity trims back the free leader transcript prior to its extension into an sg mRNA (Baker and Lai, 1990). Note that there would not be a single base pair left to hold these \u2018trimmed\u2019 leader molecules on the template. Such an enzymatic activity, which is unprecedented in +RNA viruses, exists in yeast retrotransposon Ty5 (Ke et al., 1999), in which reverse transcription is primed by an internal region in a tRNA. However, in this system, it is not a part of the duplex that is removed, but the single-stranded 3\u2032 tail of the tRNA, which cannot base-pair with the Ty5 RNA.",

            "text": "Sequence data of sg RNA leader\u2013body junctions from other arteriviruses are also difficult to reconcile with the leader-primed transcription model. For the porcine and simian arteriviruses (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Godeny et al., 1998), the leader\u2013body junctions of some sg RNAs mapped two nucleotides upstream of the body TRS, which again would not leave a single nucleotide to hold the putative free leader on the template after the hypothetical \u2018back trimming\u2019. On the other hand, these findings and our data can be explained readily by the discontinuous minus strand extension model (Figure 1C). The six-nucleotide duplex formed between the body TRS complement at the 3\u2032 end of the leaderless sg minus strand and the leader TRS in the genomic RNA template should suffice to position the nascent minus strand properly for subsequent elongation to add the complement of the leader sequence. In most cases, the nascent minus strand contains the entire body TRS complement at its 3\u2032 end at the moment of strand transfer, leading to a body TRS-derived leader\u2013body junction sequence in the sg mRNA molecule. In a small number of transcripts, however, minus strand synthesis appears to be interrupted before nucleotide +1 of the body TRS is copied and, after strand transfer, resumes by incorporating the complement of the +1 nucleotide of the leader TRS. As stated above, we postulate that the detection of this phenomenon is determined by the level of crossovers between the \u20131 and +1 position that is allowed by the mutations introduced at the +1 position of body TRS or leader TRS. We cannot, however, formally exclude that a \u2018back trimming\u2019 activity degrades the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide of the minus strand before or after strand transfer. However, note that in the discontinuous minus strand extension model (Figure 1C), such an activity would not disturb the proper positioning of the nascent minus strand on the leader template, because the TRS\u2013 TRS duplex would be shortened by one nucleotide only.",

At present, it is unknown whether EAV body TRSs are part of an RNA structural motif that is essential for body TRS function, or whether they are recognized by a protein factor in a sequence-specific manner. However, the latter seems less likely than the former, since even LB4 (Figure 2), in which five TRS nucleotides were substituted, still produced some sg RNA7, although \u223c30-fold less than the wild-type control. The fact that some sequences in the EAV genome match the leader TRS perfectly, but are not used for sg mRNA synthesis, also argues against the recognition of a specific sequence (Pasternak et al., 2000). More probably, mutagenesis of the RNA7 body TRS disturbed an RNA structure that is necessary for its function. This could, for example, explain the fact that the BU6C substitution reduced the amount of RNA7 by 20-fold (and could not be rescued by the same mutation in the leader TRS), whereas the wild-type RNA6 body TRS contains a C at the same position. If a protein factor were involved in sequence-specific TRS recognition, then one would expect it to recognize all TRSs similarly. If RNA structure is important for recognition by such a protein, then the BU6C substitution probably disturbs a structural motif of the RNA7 TRS, which is not present in the RNA6 TRS. On the other hand, conservation of part of the TRS in other arteriviruses suggests a sequence-specific recognition. Further studies are required to distinguish between these possibilities.",

The hairpin has been postulated to bind the RdRp, whereas the homology region targets the nascent strand to the crossover site. The TCV RdRp probably recognizes the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the hairpin, while individual nucleotides play a less important role (Nagy and Simon, 1998). In EAV, the leader TRS in the acceptor template is predicted to reside in the loop of an extensive hairpin, and its base pairing interaction with the body TRS complement at the 3\u2032 end of the nascent minus strand would resemble certain antisense RNA-regulated control mechanisms that are based on interactions between single-stranded tails and hairpin loops (van Marle et al., 1999a, and references therein). It is possible that the EAV RdRp, or its accessory proteins, also binds to the stem of the long hairpin that presents the leader TRS. In any case, the leader TRS itself does not seem to be recognized by a protein in a sequence-specific manner.",

            "text": "The body TRS is a better candidate to serve as a protein recognition site. This protein would then mediate the pausing of the nascent strand synthesis and/or nascent strand transfer. This would resemble the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase I termination system, in which specific DNA-binding terminator proteins bind to termination sequences (Reeder and Lang, 1997), or a function of the HIV nucleocapsid protein, which promotes the minus strand strong-stop DNA transfer (Guo et al., 1997). The EAV replicase component nsp1, which recently was shown to possess an sg RNA synthesis-specific activity (Tijms et al., 2001), may be a good candidate for such a regulatory role. Residues predicted to form a zinc finger structure in nsp1 were shown to be necessary for sg RNA synthesis. Interestingly, zinc finger structures in the HIV nucleocapsid protein facilitate strand transfer (Guo et al., 2000). Finally, it should be noted that the RNA structure of the nascent strand may also influence pausing, strand transfer or reinitiation, as illustrated by the fact that stable hairpin structures in the nascent strand promote termination of transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (Wilson and von Hippel, 1995).",
