            "text": "The efficiency of +1 ribosomal frameshifting at a specific codon is used as a sensor to regulate polyamine levels in mammalian cells. The frameshifting occurs in decoding the gene antizyme 1, which has two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Protein sequencing showed that the reading-frame shift occurs at the last codon of ORF1, causing a proportion of ribosomes to enter ORF2 to synthesize a transframe protein (Matsufuji et al., 1995). ORF2 encodes the main functional domains (Matsufuji et al., 1990; Miyazaki et al., 1992) of antizyme but has no ribosome initiation site of its own. The antizyme 1 protein binds to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (Murakami et al., 1992a; Li and Coffino, 1993, 1994), inhibits it (Heller et al., 1976) and targets it for degradation by the 26S proteosome without ubiquitylation (Murakami et al., 1992b, 1999). ODC catalyzes the first and usually rate-limiting step in the synthesis of polyamines, conversion of ornithine to putrescine. Putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine and spermine. Because of its inhibition of ODC, antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the synthesis of polyamines. In addition, antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the polyamine transporter (Mitchell et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1994; Sakata et al., 1997). As discovered by Matsufuji and colleagues (Gesteland et al., 1992) and Rom and Kahana (1994), increasing polyamine levels elevate frameshifting in decoding antizyme 1 mRNA and so increase the level of antizyme 1. Since antizyme 1 negatively regulates the synthesis and uptake of polyamines, the frameshifting is the sensor for an autoregulatory circuit. A second mammalian paralog of antizyme, antizyme 2, has very similar properties to antizyme 1, including the regulatory frameshifting, but does not stimulate degradation of ODC under certain conditions where antizyme 1 is active (Ivanov et al., 1998a; Zhu et al., 1999; Y.Murakami, S.Matsufuji, I.P.Ivanov, R.F.Gesteland and J.F.Atkins, in preparation). Just like antizyme 1, antizyme 2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the body but is 16 times less abundant than mRNA of antizyme 1 (Ivanov et al., 1998a). In addition to antizyme 1 and 2, mammals have a third paralog of the gene, antizyme 3 (also encoded by two ORFs), which is expressed only during spermatogenesis (Ivanov et al., 2000). Zebrafish also have multiple antizyme genes, which differ in their expression patterns and activities (Saito et al., 2000).",

In the cases examined, Physarum polycephalum (Mitchell and Wilson, 1983), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fonzi, 1989; Toth and Coffino, 1999) and Neurospora crassa (Barnett et al., 1988; Williams et al., 1992), added polyamines, especially spermidine, result in significant repression of ODC activity. The mechanisms of repression seem to vary from fungus to fungus and are apparently different from the mechanism of polyamine-dependent regulation of ODC in higher eukaryotes. In some cases, the existence of an antizyme-like protein has been suggested but has either been disproved, as in the case of N.crassa (Barnett et al., 1988), or has never been substantiated, as is the case with S.cerevisiae.",

            "text": "As expected from their small cationic nature and ability to neutralize negative charges locally, polyamines play key roles in processes ranging from the functioning of certain ion channels (Williams, 1997), nucleic acid packaging, DNA replication, apoptosis, transcription and translation. The role of polyamines can be complex as illustrated by the transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to a lysine residue to form hypusine in mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-5A, the only known substrate for this reaction (Tome et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1999). Spermine negatively regulates the growth of prostatic carcinoma cells at their primary site (Smith et al., 1995), but at later stages of tumor progression it fails to induce antizyme, which correlates with cells becoming refractory to spermine (Koike et al., 1999). Lack of antizyme function is also important in the early de-regulation of cellular proliferation in oral tumors (Tsuji et al., 1998) and probably others. The levels of polyamines are altered in many tumors, and inhibitors of polyamine synthesis are being tested for antiproliferative and cell death effects. The synthesis of ODC varies during the cell cycle in normal cells (Linden et al., 1985; Fredlund et al., 1995). It is induced by many growth stimuli and is constitutively elevated in transformed cells (Pegg, 1988; Auvinen et al., 1992) with some phosphorylated ODC being translocated to the surface membrane where it is important for mitotic cytoskeleton rearrangement events (Heiskala et al., 1999).",

In addition to antizyme, frameshifting is also involved in the decoding of some bacterial and yeast genes and especially in many mammalian Retroviruses and Coronaviruses, plant viruses and bacterial insertion sequences (Atkins et al., 1999). The site of frameshifting in both mammalian antizyme 1 and 2 mRNAs is UCC UGA, where quadruplet translocation occurs at UCCU (underlined) to shift reading to the +1 frame, immediately before the UGA stop codon of the initiating frame (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Ivanov et al., 1998a). For the frameshifting to occur with an efficiency of 20% or more, it is important that the 3\u2032 base of the quadruplet is the first base of a stop codon. Other important features are a pseudoknot just 3\u2032 of the shift site and a specific sequence 5\u2032 of the shift site (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Ivanov et al., 1998a). A pseudoknot 3\u2032 of the shift site is a common stimulator for eukaryotic \u20131 frameshifting, but the synthesis of antizyme is the only known case utilizing +1 frameshifting.",

A start has been made with the frameshifting required for bacterial release factor 2 expression (Persson and Atkins, 1998), but antizyme provides the first opportunity for such a comparison in eukaryotes.

The similarity is limited (\u223c10% identity, 24% similarity to both human antizyme 1 and D.melanogaster antizyme); however, it is highest in regions that are most highly conserved among the previously identified antizymes (Figure 1A). Closer examination of the cDNA nucleotide sequence provided further evidence that it encodes an S.pombe homolog of antizyme. The initiating AUG codon for the ORF that is similar to higher eukaryotic antizymes (ORF2 of those genes) is not the 5\u2032-most AUG in this cDNA. In fact, there are eight AUGs closer to the 5\u2032 end. The first or the second AUGs would initiate translation of an ORF (ORF1) that overlaps the longer downstream ORF (ORF2) such that a +1 translational frameshifting event in the overlap would generate a protein product analogous to the products of antizyme genes from higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, the last 12 nucleotides of ORF1 (UGG-UGC-UCC-UGA) are identical to the last 12 nucleotides of mammalian antizyme 1 ORF1s, including the frameshift site. Eleven of these 12 nucleotides are identical to the corresponding regions of all previously identified antizyme genes (Figure 1B). Previous experiments with the mammalian frameshift sequence tested in S.pombe have shown that this short 12 nucleotide sequence, by itself, is sufficient to stimulate measurable levels (up to 0.5%) of +1 frameshifting (Ivanov et al., 1998c). To confirm the ORF configuration of the putative S.pombe antizyme gene, a region corresponding to the two overlapping ORFs plus \u223c80 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 UTR and 370 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 UTR, was amplified from both S.pombe genomic DNA and a cDNA library. The sequence of the amplified DNA confirmed that there are indeed two overlapping ORFs with the deduced configuration. This sequence (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF217277) differs from the previously sequenced cDNA clone by three nucleotides (two in the coding region and one in the 3\u2032 UTR); one changes an alanine codon to proline, another is a silent mutation within a proline codon. Since the sequences from the cDNA library and genomic DNA are identical, we conclude that the differences with clone No. D89228 are most likely due to strain variation. This gene contains no introns within the amplified region.",

This distribution of polyamine content is very similar to that in other fungi for which polyamine concentrations have been measured (for references, see review by Tabor and Tabor, 1985). The effect of SPA deletion on cellular polyamine contents was examined in both exponentially growing and stationary phase cells (Figure 3). The cellular concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and cadaverine (but not spermine) were higher in the knockout strains than in wild-type cells. The greatest effect was seen on putrescine and cadaverine content, with smaller effects on spermidine, presumably because eukaryotic ODC activity directly catalyzes decarboxylation of both ornithine and lysine to produce putrescine and cadaverine, respectively (Pegg and McGill, 1979), but subsequent regulatory events affect homeostasis of spermidine and spermine. The effect of inactivating antizyme on the polyamine contents in exponentially growing cells is modest (<2-fold in all cases). The effect becomes very pronounced in cells in stationary phase with up to 40- and 10-fold increases of putrescine and cadaverine contents, respectively, in the knockout strains.",

One had the wild-type SPA sequence while in the second, ORF1 and ORF2 are fused in-frame. SPA wild type and an SPA deletion strain were transformed with each of the overexpression constructs. Derepression of the nmt1 promoter is a gradual process since it requires dilution of the intracellular pool of thiamine (the repressor) through cell division. After 2.5 days of exponential growth under derepressed conditions, yeast strains transformed with either SPA overexpression construct show significant increases in doubling time (Figure 4A). The growth inhibition is greater with the construct expressing the in-frame version of SPA and after prolonged incubation (5\u20137 days); these cells cease growth and accumulate in G1 as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). The fact that the in-frame overexpression construct, which differs by a single nucleotide from the wild-type construct, confers a more severe phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that translational frameshifting is required for expression of SPA. The growth phenotype associated with SPA overexpression is only partially relieved by adding 100 \u00b5M putrescine to the media (1 mM had no further effect) (data not shown). To see whether the slower growth is correlated with aberrant polyamine levels the polyamine contents of the deletion strain carrying in-frame SPA overexpression vector were measured under derepressed and repressed conditions, in both cases after 2 days of exponential growth (Figure 4B). As expected, overexpression of SPA results in significant reduction in the intracellular levels of all four polyamines.

To determine whether translational frameshifting occurs in the overlap of ORF1 and ORF2 of SPA, a region of SPA including all but the first codon of ORF1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream of the ORF1 stop codon was tested. +1 frameshifting occurred at 2.2% compared with a construct in which ORF1 and ORF2 are fused in-frame.

This prompted a search for additional stimulatory elements within the SPA frameshift cassette. The following experiments were done in a strain carrying deletion of SPA (high polyamines) because it gives higher frameshifting and higher \u03b2-galactosidase activity in general; however, we obtained similar ratios for mutant to wild-type frameshifting efficiency in a strain with the intact SPA gene. Deleting 5\u2032 sequences up to the third to last sense codon of ORF1 has little or no effect on frameshifting efficiency. Deleting all but the last sense codon (UCC) of ORF1 leads to a 4- to 5-fold reduction in frameshifting efficiency (Figure 5A). This implies that the conservation of the six nucleotides 5\u2032 of the UCC-UGA frameshift site is due to their importance for stimulating +1 frameshifting. It also suggests that no additional ORF1 sequences of SPA stimulate the +1 recoding event. The 180 nucleotide 3\u2032 region was searched for possible structure by computer RNA folding algorithms plus visual inspection. The algorithms predicted several minimal structures in that region. 3\u2032 deletion constructs (constructs del.3,3\u2032\u201381,3\u2032) tested the importance of any putative structure on the frameshifting efficiency. The results (Figure 5B and C) show that all of these deletions lead to a significant (\u223c10-fold) reduction in +1 frameshifting, indicating the presence of a major 3\u2032 stimulatory element in the 180 nucleotide region immediately following the frameshift site of SPA. However, the results indicate that none of the putative RNA structures in this region are sufficient for the activity of this element. Several additional 3\u2032 deletions delineated the boundaries of this stimulatory element from the frameshift site to 150 and 180 nucleotides downstream (since construct del.150,3\u2032 stimulates 5.5-fold more +1 frameshifting than del.129,3\u2032, 150 nucleotides downstream probably contain most of the 3\u2032 stimulator).",

An SPA+ strain was co-transformed with an SPA wild-type overexpressing plasmid (cells overexpressing wild-type SPA grow slowly but continuously) and a construct that monitors the +1 frameshifting from an SPA frameshift sequence.

The results (Figure 6) show a significant reduction (6.5-fold) in frameshifting efficiency in SPA-overproducing cells that correlates with a decrease of polyamine content (4.5-fold for putrescine and 3.9-fold for spermidine). This indicates that polyamines modulate the frameshifting efficiency of SPA. An alternative but less likely possibility is that SPA overexpression reduces frameshifting because high levels of SPA transcript titrate some factor limiting for frameshifting.",

These similarities are higher than that of SPA to these two antizyme genes and again are concentrated in the regions most highly conserved among previously identified antizymes (Figure 1A). Just like mammalian antizymes, the longer ORF (ORF2) lacks an appropriate in-frame initiation codon, and expression could be provided by initiation in a short upstream overlapping ORF (ORF1) leading to +1 ribosomal frameshifting in the overlap.

Two constructs containing the entire antizyme cDNA, one with the wild-type sequence and one with a single nucleotide deletion that fuses ORF1 to ORF2 in-frame (in-frame control), were transcribed in vitro and the RNA was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The products were examined by SDS\u2013PAGE (Figure 7). The main product from both constructs has an apparent Mr of 21 kDa, slightly greater than the predicted Mr of 17.7 kDa [aberrant, slower than expected, mobility is observed with antizyme proteins from other species (Ivanov et al., 1998a)]. From the ratio of wild-type to in-frame product, we estimate that the efficiency of frameshifting of C.elegans antizyme in reticulocyte lysate is \u223c0.8%, which is somewhat lower than SPA frameshifting in the same system. Addition of spermidine to the translation reactions almost doubles the efficiency of frameshifting to \u223c1.5% (the exact numbers are not easy to determine because of difficulty in defining background values). The frameshifting properties of C.elegans antizyme mRNA were also tested in vivo in S.pombe cells. A sequence including all but the first codon of ORF1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream was inserted between GST and lacZ of the PIU-LAC plasmid. Comparison of the \u03b2-galactosidase activity of cells (\u0394spa::LEU2 strain) transformed with the wild-type construct and the in-frame control constructs indicated 3.5% +1 frameshifting.

Interestingly, the effect is most pronounced in cells in stationary phase, where the knockout cells accumulate up to 40 times more putrescine than wild-type counterparts. This compares with a <2-fold increase of putrescine in exponentially growing cells. A likely explanation for this observation is that the usual rate of ornithine decarboxylation in exponentially growing cells is close to capacity given \u2018normal\u2019 concentrations of substrate, enzyme and product. At the same time, all newly synthesized polyamines are continuously diluted through cell growth and division at a rate that is almost identical to the rate of maximum capacity synthesis. Cells in stationary phase can no longer dilute newly synthesized polyamines, and more importantly lack an effective antizyme- independent mechanism of shutting off ODC. This suggests that SPA is the primary regulator of ODC activity in S.pombe, not only during cell growth (short term regulation) but also in non-dividing cells (longer term regulation).",

Among frameshift sites of the previously identified antizymes from mammals all the way to Drosophila, there is substantial similarity in the sequences immediately 5\u2032 of the shift site.

For the 5\u2032 sequences, generally, the more distantly related two antizymes are, the more the similarity is confined to the 3\u2032 end of that region. Our SPA ORF1 deletion data show that mutation of nucleotides that are part of the 5\u2032 consensus sequence leads to reduced frameshifting efficiency. This is another indication that conservation of nucleotide sequence in this region is because of its importance for stimulating efficient +1 frameshifting. It is quite striking that in all antizyme gene sequences identified so far, including a number of unpublished ones, ORF1 ends with a UGA stop codon. This is particularly surprising since any of the other two stop codons can substitute for UGA to stimulate antizyme 1 frameshifting, although slightly less efficiently, in vitro (Matsufuji et al., 1995) and in vivo (our unpublished results).",

            "text": "A common mechanism for frameshifting is re-pairing of the peptidyl tRNA in the new reading frame. However, an alternative mechanism whereby the peptidyl tRNA merely occludes the first base of the next codon, has been documented for yeast Ty3 frameshifting (Farabaugh et al., 1993). Results of experiments with some mutants of the mammalian antizyme 1 shift site pointed to an occlusion mechanism (Matsufuji et al., 1995). However, the mechanism with the wild-type, UCC-UGA, shift site is not clear. For C.elegans antizyme the UUU-UGA sequence would be an obvious candidate for a re-pairing since Phe-tRNA could pair perfectly with UUU in both frames. But with UCC-UGA the Ser-tRNA first reading UCC could at best pair two out of three with CCU. This important problem warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "The SPA gene was amplified using the following primers: 5\u2032-CAAAACAAGTTTTCATTATTGGTTTTTTTTAAATCAATCCCC (sense) and 5\u2032-CGTAAATCCAATCTAAATTTAATCTTCAACTAAATCATGAAAAGCCTC (antisense). The S.pombe cDNA library used as a template in the amplification was kindly provided by R.Rowley (University of Utah). The C.elegans antizyme gene was amplified using the following primers: 5\u2032-CCCAGGAATTCCTCGAGTATTTTGA GTATAATTTTAC (sense) and 5\u2032-CGGCCGCTCGAGTTAGACCTT GTAGCTCATGATG (antisense). This same amplified DNA was used to make the constructs for in vitro transcription and translation of C.elegans antizyme by cloning it into pTZ18U plasmid using the SacI and HindIII sites incorporated in the two primers. The in-frame construct was made using a two-step PCR. The cDNA sequences of O.volvulus and P.pacificus antizyme genes were obtained by performing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RACE PCR with cDNA libraries, which were kindly provided by Ralf Sommer (P.pacificus) and Susan Haynes (O.volvulus). The SPA overexpression constructs were made by amplifying the gene with the primers 5\u2032-GCATCCGAATTCCCAAATCCAAGCATCATACGCC (sense) and 5\u2032-GCATCCGGATCCGCCAGTGTTCTTACTTTGAGA TGC (antisense), and then inserting BamHI-digested product between the MscI and BamHI sites of pREP3 plasmid. The in-frame construct was made by two-step PCR and subsequently all in-frame SPA constructs described below were made by one-step PCR using this plasmid\u2019s DNA as a template. To make the constructs for frameshift assays in S.pombe, DNA fragments with a given nucleotide length (as described in the main text), were amplified from both the SPA and C.elegans antizyme constructs described above. These fragments were then cloned between the KpnI and BstEII sites of PIU-LAC plasmid (Ivanov et al., 1998c). The PCR primers included an \u2018AC\u2019 spacer between the 5\u2032 cloning site (BstEII) and the antizyme sequences in order to correct the reading frame. The in vivo frameshifting assays in S.pombe (strains ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h\u2013 and \u0394spa::LEU2 ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h\u2013) were done as described (Ivanov et al., 1998c). The plasmid for GST\u2013SPA expression was made by PCR amplifying SPA (all but the first codon of ORF1 through the downstream ORF2) from an in-frame template and cloning the product into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX-5X-3 plasmid. The antizyme frameshift site in the BMV-coat-antizyme fusion construct (C3NE) (Matsufuji et al., 1995) was mutated with a two-step PCR. To generate the two knockout strains, \u0394spa::URA4 and \u0394spa::LEU2, both ORFs of SPA were replaced exactly with the ORF of either URA4 or LEU2. To accomplish this, two pairs of primers amplified URA4 and LEU2 such that 50\u201360 nucleotides, which normally flank the two ORFs of SPA, flank the ORFs of the two genes. The amplified DNA products were gel purified and 2 \u00b5g of each were used to electroporate into ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h\u2013 cells. URA+ and LEU+ transformants were selected by growth on URA\u2013 and LEU\u2013 media, respectively. PCR screen and partial sequencing, with primers flanking the regions used for the homologous recombination, confirmed the SPA disruptions. All DNA clones were sequenced with automated sequencing machines (ABI 100).",
