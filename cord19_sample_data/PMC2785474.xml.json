Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been the major causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (6). During the past decade, despite improvements in supportive care, ALI/ARDS still carries high mortality rates between 26% and 35% (7). ALI/ARDS is characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pulmonary and systemic inflammation with a spectrum of increasing severity of lung injury resulting in respiratory failure (8). ALI frequently has systemic components, of which several of the major triggering conditions include sepsis, nonpulmonary trauma and shock. Conversely, diffuse injury and infection of the lung cause the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis (9,10). Therefore, the interaction of pulmonary and systemic inflammation exaggerates the inflammatory process and the development of ALI.",

PRRs are evolutionarily conserved receptors that sense not only pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that derived from invading microbes, but also damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are released from dead cells, thereby triggering an inflammatory response to both infectious and noninfectious insults (11). Activation of PRRs results in initiation of several extracellular activating cascades, as well as various intracellular signaling pathways that cause inflammatory responses. Figure 1 summarizes the role of PRRs in mediating infectious- and injury-induced ALI. This review will focus on recent advances in understanding of the role of PRRs in the mechanisms of ALI/ARDS.",

TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 are expressed intracellularly, whereas TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 10 are expressed on the cell surface. TLRs are expressed on a range of immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells and certain types of T cells, as well as on certain nonimmune cells, such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells that lie at potential sites of entry, including the skin and the respiratory, intestinal and genitourinary tracts. The expression of TLRs is modulated by activation, maturation or differentiation of the different cell types (15,16).",

The TIR domain is the defining motif of the TLR/IL-1 superfamily, and it is likely to be one of the earliest signaling domains to have evolved (17). TLRs can recognize a diverse range of PAMPs, generate inflammatory signals to coordinate innate immune responses and modulate adaptive immune responses. The list of TLR ligands is growing. However, the ligand for TLR10 and mouse TLR8 remains unknown at present. Activation of TLRs initiates two major pathways: the MyD88-dependent pathway, which is used by all TLRs except TLR3, resulting in the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and activator protein-1 (AP-1); and the TRIF- dependent pathway, which is initiated by TLR3 and TLR4, resulting in the activation of type I interferons (IFNs) (13,18,19). Expression of numerous proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12 and IFNs, is one of the major outcomes of the activation of the pathways (15). TLR signaling is summarized and shown in Figure 2.",

Unlike membrane-bond TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, which are localized on the endosome and recognize viral double stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA and DNA, respectively, RLRs are cytoplasmic proteins that recognize viral RNA produced as a consequence of viral replication (20,21). RLRs consist of three family members: RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) (21,22). Structurally, RIG-I and MDA5 contain a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain and two caspase-recruiting domain (CARD)-like domains required for eliciting downstream signaling pathways (23,24). The C-terminal region of RIG-I contains a repressor domain (RD), which inhibits downstream signaling. The MDA5 C-terminal region is similar to the RD of RIG-I; however, its function is not clear. LGP2 contains a DExD/H helicase domain and an RD, but lacks the CARD-like region. LGP2 was suggested to play an inhibitory role in virus-induced response, because the LGP2 RD binds the RIG-I RD and suppresses signaling as a consequence of interfering with the self-association of RIG-I (20,25,26).",

When NODs bind with PGN-derived peptides, they rapidly form oligomers, which lead to the recruitment of the receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) kinase through CARD\u2013CARD interactions (37). This complex of NOD1-RIP2 or NOD2-RIP2 then recruits the inhibitor of NK-\u03baB kinase complex (IKK), leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB.

The LPS membrane receptor complex is composed of several accessory molecules, which include phosphatidylinositol-anchored CD14, TLR4, MD2 and MD1 (50). The LPS-binding protein (LBP) enhances the binding of LPS to its receptor (51). Absence of CD14, MD2 or LBP abrogates most LPS responses (51,52). Expression of functional TLR4 has been found in many cell types in the lung (45), and LPS-induced lethal shock and ALI have been shown to be TLR4 dependent (53\u201355). Thus, TLR4 plays a critical role in the mechanism of infection-related ALI.",

The study was performed on healthy subjects with LPS or LTA instillation into the contralateral lung. Alveolar macrophages (AM\u03c6) isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The results show that whereas both LPS and LTA elicited neutrophil recruitment, only LPS instillation was associated with activation of neutrophils (PMN) (CD11b surface expression and degranulation) and consistent rises of chemokine/cytokine levels. Moreover, LPS but not LTA activated AM, as reflected by enhanced expression of proinflammatory mediators and increased spontaneous cytokine release upon incubation ex vivo. Remarkably, only LTA induced C5a release. These data suggest that stimulation of TLR2 or TLR4 results in differential pulmonary inflammation, which may be of relevance for understanding the differences during Gram-positive and Gram-negative respiratory tract infection (56).",

Although TLR2 is predominantly expressed in the first-line host defense cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and PMN) (65,66), its expression is low in ECs and epithelial cells (67). Studies from our laboratory showed that LPS through TLR4- and MyD88- dependent signaling induced TLR2 upregulation in ECs (68). We have demonstrated that TLR4 signaling, through activating NF-\u03baB, upregulates TLR2 expression in ECs, and this process is enhanced by oxidant signaling generated by PMN NAD(P)H oxidase. The functional relevance of NAD(P)H oxidase in mediating TLR4- induced TLR2 expression in ECs is evident by markedly elevated and stable ICAM-1 expression as well as augmented PMN migration in response to sequential challenge with LPS and peptidoglycan (68). Thus, TLR2 activation, signaled by TLR4 and as regulated by PMN NAD(P)H oxidase, is an important mechanism responsible for amplifying PMN transmigration to sites of infection (Figure 3).",

            "text": "The TLR4-TLR2 interaction suggests a highly coordinated, oxidant-mediated up-regulation of TLR2 in response to LPS. When one considers the interactions of the innate immune system as microbes are first encountered, the value of such temporal organization is significant. For example, Gram-negative bacteria persist in tissues and, if they are not immediately killed through the activation of PMN, complement and other antimicrobial factors, they may spill out systemically and result in septic shock. Survival in the face of such infections depends on the innate immune system, which must be able to monitor and respond to pathogens over a prolonged period of time. Given the need for a prolonged response to bacterial infection, it has always seemed somewhat surprising that response to LPS is temporally finite. This endotoxin tolerance means that within hours after exposure to LPS, innate immune cells are incapable of responding again to a rechallenge (69). But it is now clear that as LPS sensitivity wanes, the immune system has at its disposal the capability of marshaling responses via oxidative metabolites and their ability to upregulate other TLRs (70). The subsequent means of responding to bacteria depend on the ability of the innate immune system to destroy microbes and enhance the release of alternative immune stimuli. The TLRs that are utilized are the ones that bind the constituents of degrading bacteria, such as lipopeptides, PGN, heat shock proteins and CpG DNA. It seems plausible that activated PMN may even alter the phenomenon of LPS tolerance, at least in a localized context, by setting into action a positive feedback loop at sites to which PMN are chemoattracted (71). This would enhance inflammatory responses locally and help fight infection. However, in a setting of post-trauma SIRS or ALI, the primed PMN activation serves as an amplifier to cause enhanced PMN infiltration and organ injury.",

The reduced expression of GRKs lowers chemokine receptor desensitization and markedly augments the PMN migratory response.

In a model of polymicrobial sepsis in which acute lung inflammation depends on TLR4, the loss of Cblb expression accentuates acute lung inflammation and reduces survival. Cblb controls the association between TLR4 and the intracellular adaptor MyD88. Expression of WT Cblb, but not expression of a Cblb mutant that lacks E3 ubiquitin ligase function, prevents the activity of a reporter gene for NF-\u03baB in monocytes that have been challenged with LPS. The downregulation of TLR4 expression on the cell surface of PMN is impaired in the absence of Cblb. These data reveal that Cblb regulates the TLR4-mediated acute inflammatory response that is induced by sepsis (81).",

Several inflammatory agents, such as LPS, TNF, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), can delay apoptotic response, providing PMN with a longer life span, which in turn allows the PMN to accumulate at local tissue sites of inflammation/infection (84,85). Protein 53 (p53) is a transcription factor that is important in multicellular organisms, where it regulates the cell cycle and promotes apoptosis. Modulation of p53 by nutlin-3\u03b1 diminished the response of PMN and macrophages to stimulation through TLR2 or TLR4 as well as attenuated LPS-induced ALI. NF-\u03baB has been reported as a modulator of apoptosis in inflammatory cells (86). p53 can negatively regulate NF-\u03baB activity by decreasing binding of NF-\u03baB to the promoters of genes for proinflammatory cytokines.

CD44 is a transmembrane adhesion molecule and hemopoietic CD44 has an essential role in hyaluronan clearance and resolution of noninfectious lung injury. Following intratracheal LPS treatment, CD44\u2212/\u2212mice demonstrated an exaggerated inflammatory response characterized by increased inflammatory cell recruitment, elevated chemokine expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and a marked increase in NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity in lung tissue in vivo and in macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, CD44\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to LPS-induced shock. The study further found that the induction of the negative regulators of TLR signaling IL-1R\u2013associated kinase-M, Toll-interacting protein and A20 by intra-tracheal LPS in vivo and in macrophages in vitro was significantly reduced in CD44\u2212/\u2212 mice.

            "text": "Impairment of the alveolar epithelial barrier is important in the development of ALI. Under physiologic conditions the epithelial barrier is less permeable than the endothelial barrier; thus, destruction of epithelial barrier integrity prompts a progressive influx of protein-rich fluid into the alveoli (95). On the other hand, the loss of epithelial integrity represents an impairment of physiologic transepithelial fluid transport and further inhibits the reabsorption of alveolar edema (96). TLRs are critical for airway epithelial cell recognition of inhaled pathogens and for innate immune signaling. In cultured human lung epithelial cells, mRNA of all TLRs has been detected (97,98). TLR2, TLR3, TLR5 and TLR6 have the highest expression, and the ligands for these TLRs increased IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (99). TLR2 is a heterodimer with TLR1 and TLR6, and each of these is present on the airway epithelial surface. TLR3, which recognizes dsRNA or poly(I:C), is located in endosomes in un-stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells (100). TLR5 is also present on the airway epithelial surface where it can interact with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Studies have shown that TLR ligands stimulated IL-8 and VEGF production via EGFR and the downstream signaling that might include MAP kinases and NF-\u03baB (101,102). Interestingly, heat shock proteins (Hsp), such as Hsp72 and Hsp90, appear to be intimately involved in the recognition of LPS. Extracellular Hsp72 released from virally infected airway epithelial cells induces IL-8 express in human bronchial epithelial cells, resulting in the recruitment and activation of PMN via TLR4 (103,104). Type II alveolar epithelial cells can also be activated by LPS mediated through TLR4 signaling and in turn promote pulmonary inflammatory processes (105,106).",

The study further showed that PMN recruitment, microvascular and alveolar epithelial injury with protein leak in the airways, and damage of the lung microarchitecture were dependent on TLR4 gene dose. Therefore, the TLR4 expression level determines the extent of acute pulmonary response to inhaled LPS, and TLR4 may thus be a valuable target for immunointervention in acute lung inflammation as a result of infection.",

NOD1 senses diaminopimelic acid\u2013containing peptidoglycan present in Gram-negative bacteria, whereas NOD2 senses the muramyl dipeptide present in most organisms. Because of the apparent lack of direct effects on cell signaling induced by activators of NLRs, it is suggested that their role in pathogen sensing is one of cooperation with the TLRs (107). However, studies suggested that the actions of NOD1 vary between cell types and, unlike those seen with LPS, the in vivo effects may be independent of leukocyte activation. For instance, Cartwright and colleagues have shown that although selective activation of NOD1 in macrophages has no apparent effect, in vascular cells NOD1 activation results in the profound induction of NOSII and shock in vivo (108).",

These alterations in TLR4 and TLR2 expression result in HMGB1-mediated activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and expression of ICAM-1 in MLVEC that is TLR4 dependent in the early phase and switches to being TLR2 dependent in the late phase following HS. More importantly, the HS-induced surface expression of TLR2 contributes to an enhanced activation of MLVEC and augmented pulmonary PMN infiltration in response to the TLR2 agonist PGN. Thus, the study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying HS-augmented lung inflammation, namely that induction of increased TLR2 surface expression in lung endothelial cells, which is induced by HS/R and mediated by HMGB1 activation of TLR4 signaling, is an important mechanism responsible for EC-mediated inflammation and organ injury following HS (122).",

HMGB1 was originally defined as a nuclear protein that functions to stabilize nucleosome formation, and it also acts as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of several genes (71). HMGB1 can be secreted by innate immune cells in response to microbial products or other inflammatory stimuli (123,124). HMGB1 is also released by injured cells and is known as one of the main prototypes of the emerging DAMPs (125\u2013127). HMGB1 was initially identified as an inflammatory cytokine that is a late mediator of lethality in sepsis (123,124). However, recent studies suggest that HMGB1 acts as an early mediator of inflammation, contributing to the development of ALI after hemorrhage (128), and hepatic injury after liver ischemia-reperfusion (129).",

Under physiologic conditions, HA exists as a high\u2013molecular-weight polymer (>106 D) and undergoes dynamic regulation resulting in accumulation of lower molecular weight species (10\u2013500 kD) after tissue injury. HA fragments can trigger innate immune responses in a manner that overlaps with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism recognition pathways (132). It has been demonstrated that fragmented HA accumulates during tissue injury (133\u2013135). CD44 is required to clear HA during tissue injury, and impaired clearance of HA results in unremitting inflammation. Additionally, fragmented HA stimulates the expression of inflammatory genes by inflammatory cells at the injury site (136). Recently, Jiang et al. demonstrated that HA fragments require both TLR2 and TLR4 to stimulate mouse macrophages to produce inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. In a noninfectious lung injury model, mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR4 showed an impaired transepithelial migration of inflammatory cells, increased tissue injury, elevated lung epithelial cell apoptosis and decreased survival (132). Lung epithelial cell overexpression of high molecular mass HA protected mice against ALI and apoptosis, in part through TLR-dependent basal activation of NF-\u03baB. The exaggerated injury in TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice appears to be due to impaired HA-TLR interactions on epithelial cells. These studies demonstrate that host\u2013matrix component HA and TLR interactions provide signals that initiate inflammatory responses, maintain epithelial cell integrity and promote recovery from ALI (136).",

A recent report has demonstrated that TLR4, but not TLR2, played a role in development of the inflammatory response after short-time MV (142). MV not only causes ventilator-induced lung injury in healthy animals, but also exacerbates damage in the injured lung (143). TLR4 blockade reduces pulmonary inflammation caused by the combination of LPS and MV (144). In the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced ALI, TLR3 expression and activation seems impotent. Exposure of human epithelial cells to hyperoxia in the absence of an exogenous viral pathogen significantly increased TLR3 expression. In vivo studies showed that both the absence of TLR3 via gene deletion in mice and the presence of an anti-TLR3 antibody in wild-type mice conferred significant protection in a hyperoxia-mediated lung injury model (145).",

Gasse and colleagues reported that uric acid locally produced in the lung upon bleomycin (BLM)-induced DNA damage and degradation triggers NALP3 inflammasome activation, and in turn causes lung injury (146). Reduction of uric acid levels using the inhibitor of uric acid synthesis allopurinol or uricase leads to a decrease in BLM-induced IL-1\u03b2 production, lung inflammation, repair and fibrosis. Local administration of exogenous uric acid crystals recapitulates lung inflammation and repair, which depend on the NALP3 inflammasome, MyD88 and IL-1R1 pathways and TLR2 and TLR4 for optimal inflammation but are independent of the IL-18 receptor (146). Babelova et al., however, reported the role of biglycan, a ubiquitous LRR proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix, in mediating ALI through interacting with TLR2 and TLR4 on macrophages (147). The study showed that in macrophages soluble biglycan induces the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome and subsequent activation of caspase-1 and release of mature IL-1\u03b2 without need for additional costimulatory factors. This is caused by the interaction of biglycan with TLR2/4 and purinergic P2 \u00d7 4/P2 \u00d7 7 receptors, which induces receptor cooperativity. Furthermore, ROS formation is involved in biglycan-mediated activation of the inflammasome. By signaling through TLR2/4 biglycan stimulates the expression of NLRP3 and pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 mRNA. These results provide evidence for direct activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by biglycan and suggest a fundamental paradigm of how tissue stress and injury are monitored by innate immune receptors detecting the release of the extracellular matrix components and turning such a signal into a robust inflammatory response (147).",

This finding led to a number of studies investigating the potential impact of these TLR4 polymorphisms on the course of infectious diseases and the development of septic shock and TLR4 polymorphisms (150\u2013152). These polymorphisms do not seem to confer susceptibility to all Gram-negative infections, because other groups (153,154) have shown no correlation in other infectious diseases such as meningococcal disease, and again one should be mindful that very significant hypofunctioning TLR4 alleles are likely to have a very strong negative selection pressure across the generations (155). TLR-2 polymorphisms have also been linked to susceptibility to staphylococcal infection (156) and lepromatous leprosy (157,158). Although some of these studies are still relatively small in scale, they reinforce the important role of TLRs in pathogen recognition and immune response in humans. CD14 polymorphisms, key accessory molecules for TLR signaling, have been associated with increased prevalence of positive bacterial culture findings and sepsis attributed to Gram- negative infections in a critically ill population (159), as well as the susceptibility to chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in patients with coronary artery disease (160).",

TLRs are the most extensively studied family of PRRs, and thus recently developed new drugs mainly target TLRs and are either agonists of TLRs to enhance immune responses against infectious agents or antagonists designed to reduce inflammation due to infection or autoimmune responses (161). The approaches to modulating TLR activity have focused on the following aspects: (a) ligands or analogues such as Eritoran (E5564) from Eisai (Woodcliff Lake, NJ, USA), a synthetic analogue of bacterial lipid A that inhibits LPS from activating cells through the TLR4/CD14/MD2 complex (162\u2013164); (b) monoclonal antibodies, soluble receptors and other accessory proteins, such as a natural soluble form of TLR2, found in mouse plasma and breast milk, which acts to block TLR2 ligand stimulation (165), and a member of the TLR/IL-1 receptor family (TIR8 or SIGIRR) that inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling and may be an endogenous inhibitor of the TLR system (166); (c) signal transduction blockers; many of the key molecules in the signaling pathways for each TLR have been identified and are considered potential drug targets (167\u2013169). The structural bases of TIR domain interactions between TLRs and adapters such as MyD88, Mal, TRAM and TRIF have been modeled, and small peptidic sequences based on the TIR domain BB loop or peptidomimetics of this region have been made that can block the interactions (110,169,170). (d) siRNA and anti-sense; studies with knockout mice suggest that deficiency in individual TLRs has limited consequences for animals under normal conditions, but exhibits impact under conditions of specific infectious challenge (110,171,172). However, siRNA sequences themselves may be ligands for intracellular TLRs (173); thus attention to the design of appropriate sequences is necessary.",

TLR2 (TLR2 in association with TLR1 or TLR6), TLR4, TLR5 and TLR11 are localized on the cell surface for ligand recognition. TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 are localized in the endosome for ligand recognition in the lumen of endosome. All TLRs, except TLR3, recruit MyD88, and TLR1, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 recruit the additional adaptor TIRAP, which links the TIR domain with MyD88. TLR3 and TLR4 recruit TRIF. TLR4 requires the additional linker adaptor TRAM, which links the TIR domain of TLR4 with TRIF. Stimulation of the cells with TLR1, TLR2, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR11 ligands initiates the MyD88-dependent pathway whereas TLR3 ligands initiate the TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR4 activates both MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways. In the MyD88-dependent pathway, MyD88 recruits the IRAK family of proteins and TRAF6. In turn, TRAF6 activates TAK1. The activated TAK1 activates the IKK complex, which activates NF-\u03baB subunits. The activated TAK1 also activates the MAPK pathway. In the TRIF-dependent pathway, TRIF interacts with RIP1 and TRAF6. Activated TRAF6 and RIP1 activate NF-\u03baB and MAPKs. TRIF also interacts with TRAF3 and activates TBK1/IKKi, which activate IRF3 and IRF7. Cells stimulated with TLR7 and TLR9 ligands activate NF-\u03baB and MAPKs via the MyD88-dependent pathway. To induce type I IFNs, MyD88 associates with the IRAK family of proteins. IRAK1 and IKK\u03b1 activate IRF7. IRAK1 also interacts with TRAF3 and activates IRF7. The activated NF-\u03baB subunits and IRFs are translocated to the nucleus. NF-\u03baB and MAPKs initiate the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes whereas IRFs initiate the transcription of type I interferons.

LPS stimulation induces NAD(P)H oxidase activation and production of ROS in PMN as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling in ECs and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMN to ECs is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMN to transmit oxidant signals to ECs. The oxidants augment NF-\u03baB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMN to ECs and increased PMN migration. Thus, the PMN NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated TLR4-TLR2 cross-talk activates a positive feedback signal leading to sustained and amplified endothelial activation in response to invading pathogens.

Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-\u03b3\u2013activated signaling is postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2 internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating the cross-talk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory signals.
