It was first discovered in the early 1960s in poliovirus (1,2) and has been documented in various genera of animal viruses, plant viruses and bacterial viruses group. Studies conducted on viruses during the last 40 years indicated that RNA\u2013RNA recombination could occur between RNAs of the same or different strains of one species (3,4), of different species (5) or between viral and host cellular RNAs (6,7). RNA hairpins or mutations in a replicase domain have been implicated to play an important role in promoting RNA\u2013RNA recombination (8\u201311). While none of those studies demonstrated a role for non-replicase proteins in viral RNA\u2013RNA recombination or selection of recombinants, recombination without replication has been described (12,13).",

            "text": "RNA recombination has been studied extensively in the plant virus genus Cucumovirus. Those studies have involved two of the three recognized viral species in this genus, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Tomato aspermy virus (TAV). These viruses both contain a single-stranded and positive-sense RNA genome divided into three species designated RNAs 1, 2 and 3 (14,15). RNA 1 encodes the 1a protein involved in virus replication (16,17). RNA 2 encodes two proteins: the 2a, also involved in virus replication (16,17) and the 2b protein, involved in virus movement and the suppression of RNA silencing (18\u201321). RNA 3 also encodes two proteins, the 3a movement protein and the capsid protein, both of which are also involved in virus movement (22\u201324). Protein 2b is translated from a subgenomic RNA of RNA 2, RNA 4A (25,26), while the capsid protein is translated from a subgenomic RNA of RNA 3, RNA 4 (27). The 3\u2032 terminal 305\u2013310-nt non-translated region (NTR) is nearly identical in each of the three genomic RNAs of each virus and represents promoters for (\u2212) viral RNA synthesis during viral replication (23,28,29). The location of most of the recombinants described involving CMV and TAV is within these 3\u2032 NTR sequences.",

            "text": "RNA\u2013RNA recombination was first described in cucumoviruses isolated from tobacco plants after multiple passage of a pseudorecombinant (reassortant) virus containing RNAs 1 and 2 from CMV, and RNA 3 from TAV (30). The progeny RNA 3 consisted mostly of TAV RNA 3 but with the 3\u2032 terminal sequence from CMV RNA 2. In addition, in an earlier passage, there was an intermediate RNA 3 present containing a duplicated 21-nt sequence at the crossover site (30). Subsequently, several other cucumoviral recombinant RNAs were also discovered in plants infected with a so-called quadripartite hybrid virus having RNAs 2 and 3 from CMV, and RNAs 1 and 2 from TAV (31), with a mixture of wild-type (wt) CMV and wt TAV (32,33), with mixed CMV isolates (34\u201336), or within a single wt CMV (37). These characterized recombinant RNAs had non-template-derived nucleotides at the crossover site (31) and had CMV sequences at one end of the crossover site and TAV sequence at the other end (32) or had the same 3\u2032-terminal NTR sequence for all three genomic RNAs (37). Some of the recombinants had crossover sites localized within a short region of high sequence similarity (32). Others were predicted to occur in regions of high secondary structure (33,34,38). TAV RNA 3 itself has a direct repeat of 163 nt (differing by one nucleotide) in the 3\u2032 NTR, which is not essential for infection (39) and in some cases, was deleted during long-term incubation (40). While some of the above studies examined recombinants formed in the directly inoculated leaves and thus avoided detecting only those replicable recombinants that might be selected (32,33), other studies examined those recombinants detected after slow selection (31,38) and found that some recombinants could co-exist in the same plants (38). However, what factors may have led to the selection of particular recombinants has not previously been examined.",

However, the effects of the various viral genes on the selection of these recombinant viruses have not been examined. Previously, using interspecies hybrid viruses, we examined the roles of different 2b genes on virulence and virus accumulation and showed that while the nature of the 2b gene influenced virulence, the RNA 3 (and therefore the two genes encoded by RNA 3; the 3a movement protein and the capsid protein) did not (21,47). Therefore, the hybrid viruses generated previously, C1C2T2BC3 and C1C2T2BT3, where C indicates Q-CMV, T indicates TAV, 1, 2 and 3 indicate RNAs 1, 2 and 3, and the subscript T2B indicates that the 2b gene of Q-CMV was replaced precisely with that of TAV (Figure 1), were subjected to long-term, multiple passages in N. glutinosa to determine whether the 2b gene had any effect on the selection of recombinant viruses. The progeny viral RNAs were examined by northern blot hybridization, with probes specific to the 3\u2032 terminal NTR sequences of either the three Q-CMV RNAs or the three TAV RNAs (Figure 1). This analysis indicated that in the multiple passage plants TAV RNA 3 derived from C1C2T2BT3 had recombined with CMV RNA, as the progeny RNA 3 was detected by both the Q-CMV-specific and TAV-specific probes (Figure 2A and B, compare lanes 9 and 20). By contrast, RNA 3 derived from the same virus maintained for several weeks in the plasmid-inoculated plants was not a recombinant RNA, as it was only detected by the TAV-specific probe, but not by the Q-CMV-specific probe (Figure 2A and B, compare lanes 5 and 16). The specificity of the CMV-specific and TAV-specific probes was demonstrated in that both probes only detected their own specific viral RNAs (Figure 2A and B, compare lanes 2 and 3, and lanes 13 and 14). The other RNAs of C1C2T2BT3 were still detected by their specific probes in both the inoculated plants and the multiple passage plants (Figure 2A and B).\n",

However, as the replacement of the 2b sequence also changed the sequences encoding the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein, it cannot be ruled out that the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein might play a role in the recombination and/or selection. Therefore, to determine whether the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein encoded by the overlapping TAV 2a gene sequence had such a role, we introduced a stop codon upstream of the TAV 2b gene in C2T2B to prevent the expression of the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein (see C2T2BC2a in Figure 1). Bioassay of C1C2T2BC2aT3 onto N. glutinosa showed that the virus induced symptoms similar to those induced by C1C2T2BT3 and northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR analyses showed that recombinant RNA 3 still accumulated in the multiple passage plants, but not in the inoculated plants (data not shown). Moreover, the recombinant RNA 3 generated was the same as that derived from C1C2T2BT3 (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein encoded by the TAV 2b sequence had no role in the recombination and/or selection, indicating that the TAV 2b gene was required for the recombination and/or selection.",

The binding ability increased with an increasing amount of the 2b protein (Figure 4C, compare lanes 1\u20134). By contrast, comparable amounts of GST alone, which was expressed and purified under the same conditions as the TAV 2b protein (Figure 4B, lane 2), did not bind to TAV RNA 3 (data not shown). This demonstrated that RNA-binding activity was not due to a co-purified, contaminating protein from E. coli. The significance of the more efficient binding of the 2b protein to (+) versus (\u2212) sense RNA is unknown. The different binding abilities probably are due to different sequences and/or structures between RNA 3(+) and RNA 3(\u2212).

Second, the 3\u2032 terminal NTR of the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2W2BT3 contained a Q-CMV RNA 2 NTR sequence, rather than the Q-CMV RNA 1 NTR sequence (compare Figure 3A right and B right). Third, the crossover sites on RNA 2 and on RNA 3 were different in the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2W2BT3 versus either C1C2T2BT3 or C1C2T2BC2aT3 (compare Figure 3A and B). And fourth, the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2W2BT3 contained an imperfect repeat of 19 nt near the crossover site preceded by an A between the TAV RNA 3 sequence and the 3\u2032 CMV RNA sequence (Figure 3B). Moreover, the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2W2BT3 also was missing the second 163-nt repeat. These similarities on one hand and differences on the other suggested that the recombinant RNA 3s derived from C1C2T2BT3 and C1C2T2BC2aT3 versus C1C2W2BT3 might be generated using different templates, but occurred via a similar mechanism.

To determine when the recombinant RNA 3s could first be detected, a time-course experiment was done involving three viruses: C1C2T2BT3, C1C2T2BC2aT3 and C1C2W2BT3. The appropriate plasmid combinations were inoculated onto 10 N. glutinosa plants and sap was then passaged onto healthy N. glutinosa plants for 10 passages, at 6-day intervals. The inoculated leaves of the passage plants were detached 3 days after inoculation, total RNAs were extracted and the RNAs were analysed by northern blot hybridization. These analyses showed that the recombinant RNAs were only detected from the fourth passage and onwards in plants infected with C1C2T2BT3 or C1C2T2BC2aT3, or from the sixth passage and onwards in plants infected with C1C2W2BT3 (Supplementary Figure 1A, data not shown). These results indicated that selection of the recombinant RNA 3s is a slow process and therefore it seems more likely that the 2b proteins were selecting for specific recombinants, rather than being involved in the generation of the recombinant RNA 3s. This is also consistent with the different subcellular localization of the replication proteins and the 2b protein (49\u201351) and the lack of detectable interaction of the replicase proteins with the 2b protein (52). In addition, virus containing the TAV 2b protein showed selection of the recombinant RNA 3s two passages earlier than did virus containing the WAII-CMV 2b protein. Therefore, it seems likely that the source of the 2b protein also affected the rate of selection.",

After inoculation of each virus to 200 plants, leaves were detached from groups of five inoculated plants at 1-day intervals for up to 40 days.

Three deletion mutants were constructed: C1\u039423, C2T2B\u039423 and T3\u0394163(A)\u039423, where the conserved 23-nt sequence was deleted from each of C1, C2T2B and T3\u0394163(A), respectively. Co-inoculation of each deletion mutant in the combinations C1\u039423 with C2T2B\u039423 and T3\u0394163(A)\u039423, C1\u039423 with C2T2B and T3\u0394163(A), C1 with C2T2B\u039423 and T3\u0394163(A), or C1 with C2T2B and T3\u0394163(A)\u039423, onto N. glutinosa and N. clevelandii plants, showed that none of these combinations was able to infect the plants (Table 1). However, when either C1\u039423 was combined with C2 and C3, or T3\u0394163(A)\u039423 was combined with T1 and T2, the mixtures were infectious (Table 1), indicating that the presence of this 23-nt sequence is essential for infection of the pseudorecombinant viruses, but not the parental viruses. Since the pseudorecombinant viruses containing the 23-nt sequence were viable without detectable recombination for some time (Figure 2), these results indicate that the 23-nt sequence is not essential for replication of the pseudorecombinant virus, but may be essential for maintaining infection of the pseudorecombinant viruses through the plants, just as the 2b protein was required for this task, but not for the maintenance of infection of the parental viruses (19,21).\n",

            "text": "The above results showed that the CMV sequence in the recombinant RNA 3 was similar or identical to the CMV RNA 5 sequence. Correspondingly, the TAV RNA 3 sequence in the same recombinant RNA 3s lacked the second 163-nt repeat and the rest of the 3\u2032 NTR (which together corresponds to the TAV RNA 5 sequence). To determine whether CMV RNA 5 itself or the 3\u2032 NTR of CMV RNAs 1 and/or 2 could be used as a template for the synthesis of the recombinant RNA 3, we prepared the appropriate templates that would be expressed transiently in inoculated plants and assessed these for the presence of recombinant virus. In the templates, we deleted 326 nt from the 3\u2032 NTR of T3 to make T31\u20132060, and deleted the first 163-nt repeat plus 141 nt from the 3\u2032 NTR of T3 to make T3\u0394163(A)\u0394141 (Figure 1). These two deletions had the same length of the TAV RNA 3 sequence as in the recombinant RNAs. In addition, we also made four RNA 5-like cDNA clones, C13081\u20133390, C2W2B2757\u20133065, T31902\u20132386 and T32065\u20132386. The former two were based on the CMV RNA 1 and C2W2B sequences in the recombinant viruses, respectively, while the latter two were based on the sequence of TAV RNAs 3B and 5, respectively (39). All of these clones were placed into the pCass1 vector, under transcriptional control of the CaMV 35S RNA promoter and terminator sequences. The infectivity results of the various plasmid mixtures tested on N. glutinosa and N. clevelandii plants are shown in Table 1. The combinations C1, C2T2B, T31\u20132060, versus C1, C2T2B, T3\u0394163(A)\u0394141, versus C1, C2W2B, T3\u0394163(A)\u0394141 all showed no infectivity. The addition of the plasmids expressing the 3\u2032-terminal NTRs C13081\u20133390, C2W2B2757\u20133065, T31902\u20132386 or T32065\u20132386 into each mixture did not result in infectivity (Table 1). These results indicate that the sequences containing the 3\u2032 NTR are essential for the viral infection and could not be separated functionally from the rest of the TAV RNA 3 sequence. In addition, the results also indicate that the recombination observed in other experiments did not occur during the synthesis of (\u2212) sense RNA from (+) sense templates, since there was no repair of the 3\u2032 NTR from synthesis initiated on either genomic RNAs 1 or 2, or subgenomic RNAs 3B or 5 (Table 1) and template switching to TAV RNA 3 lacking the 3\u2032 NTR. Such repair recombination is common among tombusviruses (8,53) and occurs with the related brome mosaic virus (54\u201356). Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the recombination occurred during (+) sense RNA synthesis on the (\u2212) sense RNA templates, with recombination occurring as a result of template switching of the viral replicase from the donor (TAV RNA 3) strand to the acceptor (CMV RNA) strand.",

            "text": "This model assumes that intramolecular recombination is a more frequent event than intermolecular recombination. Therefore, generation of TAV RNA 3 progeny with deletion of one of the 163-nt repeats is more likely to occur than recombination between TAV RNA 3 and another viral genomic RNA. That is, if one repeat is missing, then only intermolecular recombination can occur, which may explain why the recombinants were seen to accumulate more rapidly in the plants directly inoculated with virus containing only one repeat (Figure 2). On the other hand, loss of a repeat was not a prerequisite for intermolecular recombination, since intramolecular recombination would involve loss of the first repeat [163(A)], while the recombinants formed from the full-length T3 all retained the first repeat. Intramolecular recombination would be expected to occur during (+) TAV RNA 3 synthesis, if the polymerase jumped from the beginning of the first repeat in stem-loop L2 (Figure 7A) to the beginning of the second repeat in stem-loop L1 (Figure 7B). These sequences also contain the putative RNA 5 subgenomic promoter sequence (33,38) that would facilitate this recombination and those described previously that involved this \u2018hot spot\u2019 for intermolecular recombination between TAV and CMV (33,38). The presence of another stem-loop structure (K1/K2 in Figure 7) immediately adjacent to the putative subgenomic promoter may slow the polymerase down sufficiently to stutter and in some cases switch templates. In the case of the first TAV-CMV RNA 3 recombinant described (30), this occurred just before another stem-loop structure in the first repeat (J2 in Figure 7A; see arrow), but in that instance, the polymerase jumped to the putative RNA 5 subgenomic promoter of (\u2212) CMV RNA 2, leading to an initial recombinant that had a duplication of the two, putative subgenomic RNA promoters, which then led to a second recombination event, with the intervening TAV RNA 3 sequences deleted, giving the final, stable recombinant RNA 3 described (30).",

Rather, the polymerase jumped back to the subgenomic promoter stem-loop (L2) and copied this through the A residue in the gap between stem-loops L2 and K2 (Figure 7A), before pausing and jumping to the same subgenomic promoter sequence on (\u2212) CMV RNA 2. The small difference in \u0394G between the 6 bp stem-loop K2 in (\u2212) TAV RNA 3 (\u0394G = \u22122.7 kcal/mol) and a weaker 3 bp stem-loop (K\u2032) structure adjacent to the subgenomic promoter in (\u2212) CMV RNA 2 (\u0394G = \u22122.1 kcal/mol) may be sufficient to prevent the polymerase from pausing at the base of stem-loop K\u2032 in (\u2212) CMV RNA 2. This explains the duplication of the 19 nt seen in Figure 5D, following the A residue (from copying the first nucleotide, U-1902 of the RNA 5/3B promoter). In the case of C1C2W2BT3, the same recombinant progeny RNA 3 is seen, but it must have been generated from a different starting point, since the second repeat is present in the template but missing in the recombinant progeny RNA 3. Here, template switching occurred either immediately after nucleotide 2084 (the A residue in the gap between stem-loops L1 and K1), again leading to a partially duplicated subgenomic promoter with the 19 nt repeat, or it occurred at nucleotide 2064, in the lower region of stem-loop L1 (Figure 7B), and then proceeded as described above for C1C2W2BT3\u0394163(G).",

Therefore, while the nature of the receptor RNA and the apparently slow selection of the recombinants (Figures 2 and 6) were determined by the 2b gene, the generation of recombinants at position 2245 was determined by the absence of the first repeat. Since the first and second repeats differ by only one nucleotide (underlined blue letters in Figure 7A and B, at positions 1966 and 2129), we propose that there must be a difference in structure between the virus containing only one repeat, when this is the second repeat versus the first repeat, and that this difference in structure affects pausing by the polymerase, leading to switchover to another template. This difference could be the presence (or absence) of a weak pseudoknot structure formed between the three A residues in the loop of stem-loop G and the three U residues in the non\u2013base-paired region between stem-loops K2 and J2 (see blue letters in Figures 7). This pseudoknot would not be stable in T3\u0394163(A), since it would only contain two A:U base pairs. This weak pseudoknot structure may be sufficient to affect pausing by the polymerase in the T3\u0394163(G) variant, if it can re-form after the polymerase has gone through it the first time and then transcribed through the various, following stem-loop structures (stem-loops J, I and H in Figure 7), leading to template switching in stem-loop G. However, as this pseudoknot is absent in T3\u0394163(A), the polymerase would continue through stem-loop G until it pauses at the base of stem-loop E (Figure 7C; \u0394G = \u22126.8 kcal/mol), before switching to the receptor RNA.",

It is conceivable that the selection of recombinant RNAs is a manifestation of the RNA silencing suppression-related functions of the 2b proteins, since some of these also vary between strains of CMV (57,58). However, based on the spatial separation of the 2b protein from the replication machinery within the cell (49\u201351), it is difficult to envision how different 2b proteins provide the selection observed through their RNA silencing suppressor functions. In the case of the tombusvirus cucumber necrosis virus, inhibition of expression of the 20-kDa protein now known to be the RNA silencing suppressor of this virus, led to the rapid appearance of defective-interfering RNAs (59). Thus, in that, the absence of the silencing suppressor led to enhanced generation or selection of recombinant RNAs, while in the case of CMV, the source of the 2b protein determined the nature of the recombinant RNAs selected and pseudorecombinant viruses could not be selected in its absence (21). Moreover, in the case of influenza virus, where the NS1 gene encodes an RNA silencing suppressor (60), mutation in a different gene (NS2) led to the rapid appearance of defective interfering particles (61). At the time it was thought that the influenza NS2 protein might be involved in replication. In fact, the NS2 protein is involved in selecting ribonucleoprotein complexes for transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is now called the nuclear export protein (62).",

The different forms of recombinant RNAs generated may have different affinities for the various 2b proteins, leading to selection of one recombinant form over another by a particular 2b protein, which leads eventually to selection of the recombinant RNA over the parental RNA. Since selection to reach detectable levels was only observed after several weeks, the recombinant viral RNAs do not appear to be under strong selection pressure, although there is clearly a gradual selection for the recombinant RNAs over the parental RNA 3. This was seen in the slow appearance of the recombinant RNAs in both sets of time course experiments (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 1). The rate of selection could be tested further by direct competition experiments. The Q-CMV 2b protein did not select for any recombinants, while the TAV and WAII-CMV 2b proteins selected for different recombinants, possibly reflecting differences in their RNA-binding properties. It would also be interesting to determine whether various 2b mutants would show differences in their selection of different recombinants.",

            "text": "Figure 7.: Proposed secondary structure of RNA 3 sequences complementary to the 3\u2032 NTR of TAV RNA 3. The residues are numbered according to the corresponding (+) RNA 3, with nucleotide 1902 (underlined) as the position complementary to the 5\u2032 first nucleotide of TAV RNA 3B. Stem-loops are labelled starting from the 5\u2032 end of the (\u2212) TAV RNA 3, as complementary to those stem-loops of the 3\u2032 end of (+) TAV RNA 3 (A\u2013H) described previously (64). Those stem-loops present in the first 163-nt repeat (L2-H2) are shown in (A), while those present in the second 163-nt repeat (L1-H1) and loop G are shown in (B), with the remaining 5\u2032 proximal stem-loops and non-base-paired sequences of (\u2212) TAV RNA 3 shown in (C). The sites of recombination observed here are indicated by an asterisk (nucleotide 2060), a dagger (nucleotide 2064) or an arrow (nucleotide 2245) in (B and C). The site of recombination described in Ref. (30) is at position 1973 and is indicated by an arrow in (A). The single nucleotide difference (nucleotides 1966 and 2129) between the first and second 163-nt repeat is shown in blue and is underlined. A possible pseudoknot can be formed between the three As at the top of stem-loop G and the three Us (shown in blue) in the non-base-paired region between stem-loops K2 and J2 in the first 163-nt repeat, but not with the corresponding CUU sequence shown in the second 163-nt repeat. [Note: Neither stem-loops B nor F are indicated, since loop B did not contain a stem in (+) TAV RNA 3 (64) and small stem-loop F was composed of several non-canonical G\u2013U base pairs in (+) TAV RNA 3 (54) and is not present in (\u2212) TAV RNA 3]. The \u0394G values (kcal/mol) for the various stem-loops are A = \u221211.5, C = \u22127.8, D = \u22128.4, E = \u22126.8, G = \u22121.3, H = \u22122.9, I = \u22124.8, J = \u22123.8, K = \u22122.7, L1 = \u22126.9 and L2 = \u22125.7, as calculated from Ref.
