It was detected in human, birds and mosquitoes in Egypt at the beginning of the fifties, and has then been found in various European countries [1]. It is however only with the important 1996 human epidemic in Bucharest, Romania, that WNV became a concern for public health. Moreover, there is no specific treatment of the disease and no vaccine is yet available for humans. The WNV was detected on the American continent in 1999 and more specifically in New York [2]. In Canada, WNV reached southern Ontario in 2001, while the first human cases were detected in August 2002 [3].",

Such a forecast, if it proved to be reliable, would allow public health authorities to initiate preventative actions at the right time and places and at the appropriate level of expected risk. Currently, one main control activity is larvicide spraying in urban and rural settings in order to reduce the population of mosquitoes infected with WNV. However, it remains difficult to determine the at-risk zones on a scientific basis and the efficacy of such measures has been challenged [5], not to mention their high cost and environmental impacts. The identification of vulnerable zones and risk levels in due time remains a significant challenge for public health management due to the complexity of the phenomena related to the virus transmission.",

This approach makes it possible to simulate the behaviours of thousands of agents in geo-referenced virtual spaces. The MAGS System (Multi-Agent GeoSimulation) recently developed by Dr. Moulin's Groupe de Recherche en Informatique Cognitive at Laval University, can be used to create such simulations in virtual environments generated with georeferenced data obtained from geographic information systems (GIS). These agents are characterized by cognitive capacities such as perception of the environment and its content, autonomous navigation and reasoning [6]. Although one of the first applications of MAGS was related to the simulation of crowd behaviours in urban environments, MAGS is a generic platform allowing the simulation of several types of behaviours in various geo-referenced virtual environments. For example, it has already been used to simulate the behaviour of consumers visiting shopping centers and firemen intervention plans to contain the propagation of forest fires [7].",

Indeed, there are mainly two populations involved in the transmission of the WNV: the population of mosquitoes (Culex sp.) and the population of birds. In this paper, we mainly consider the Corvidae family and more specifically crows which have been chosen by public health authorities as indicator birds for the WNV. Mosquitoes spawn eggs in sumps and other shelters. The larvae hatch from eggs and evolve into nymphs that emerge to become adult mosquitoes. This cycle mainly depends on temperature and humidity [9]. Besides, human intervention can reduce the population of mosquitoes through larvicide treatments (e.g. Methoprene) in order to kill larvae. The transmission of the WNV occurs mainly mosquitoes biting birds. An infected mosquito can infect a bird, which can in turn infect healthy mosquitoes that will subsequently bite the infected bird before its death [10].",

During early spring bird couples spread over the whole territory and remain for few months around their nesting areas. By the end of July, which happens to be the very beginning of human infections in Quebec [3], Corvidae change their social behaviour and regroup in roosts at night. During the day, the birds fly to surrounding areas in search of food, but they go back to the roosts at night [11]. At the end of fall, many of them migrate to warmer areas south of the province [12]. Furthermore, the transmission of WNV to the populations of Corvidae can occur either by mechanical infection (an infection after a direct contact between birds) or through the biting of a healthy Corvidae by an infected mosquito (Figure 1).",

However, given the enormous complexity involved in representing such phenomena and the lack of detailed data, we had to raise a number of reasonable simplifying hypotheses with regard to the species of mosquitoes and Corvidae of interest, to the factors influencing the evolution of these populations, the geographical region selected for the analysis, the period of simulation and the space-time scale. These hypotheses led us to identify a set of key parameters to carry out the simulations, based on the epidemiologic and surveillance experience with WNV in North America and more precisely in the province of Quebec [4]. For example, considering the availability of surveillance data, we selected the American crow as the main indicator bird species; and the Culex pipiens and Culex restuans as the main mosquito's species susceptible to bite crows (and possibly humans). Another example is the period of simulation for the WNV propagation: July 1st to October 1st was selected as the critical time window during which human cases have appeared in Quebec so far (Table 1).",

Let us briefly comment upon this model which represents the evolution and interactions of Culex sp. (pipiens/restuans) and crows. Moreover, we simplified the biological cycle of Culex to only consider the change from a larval state to an adult one. From a public health management's point of view, these two states are the most important ones since the virus is spread by adult females and treatments against the progression of the WNV are carried out using larvicides. This simplification has been validated by domain experts (see below). In addition, considering the spatial dynamics of crow populations, we selected the period of the year when Corvidae regroup in roosts. In our model, a roost is considered as the spatial extension of an aggregate of crows (a sub-population of crows which gathers in this roost for the period of the year of interest). During the day, crows fly a variable distance from the roost in search of food, and return at night. Hence, the spatial phenomenon of gathering and dispersion of this sub-population of crows can be represented in a synthetic way in the form of an expansion and a contraction of the area occupied by this sub-population. The surface over which the birds spread during the day (\"roost expansion\") depends on the roost size. Consequently, we can take into account the variable density of crows in this dynamically changing area. Another fact to consider is that the Culex mosquito has a mostly nocturnal activity [13]. Therefore, the crows located in roosts at night will be good targets for them. Moreover, preset variables have been used in order to compute parameters such as the infection probabilities and the mortality proportions. This conceptual model has been validated by domain experts (from the GDG Company, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke and Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois Rivi\u00e8res \u2013 UQTR) and was used to orient the development of the geosimulation tool.",

This intelligent density map is a kind of cellular automaton associated with rules that enable the system to simulate the evolution of the different categories of mosquitoes (larvae, adults, healthy, infected, etc.) in each reference area under the conditions that influence the mosquitoes' life cycle (temperature and precipitations). The system gets these conditions either from actual meteorological data (from specific databases: see Section 4.3) or from the parameters set in scenarios that the user wants to explore. This map contains the polygons representing all the municipalities of the Quebec province (the reference areas).

Hence, the set of particles associated with a given roost covers a circular area with a maximal radius set by the operating range parameter. We calibrated the parameters of the particle system by computing the density of crows in the area covered by the expansion of the roost and comparing it to observed field data and other estimated data.",

Indeed, while traveling in the geographic space, one or several crows represented by a particle can cross areas in which Culex mosquitoes are located. Consequently, there is a probability that some of these crows will be bitten. Technically, in order to determine the probabilities of encounters between mosquitoes and crows, the corresponding particle takes into account the characteristics of the Culex population associated with each reference area of the 'intelligent density map' over which it travels. Therefore, the system can estimate the number of infected individuals, based on the likelihood that a number of individual crows be bitten by mosquitoes and be infected with WNV (using the equations of the mathematical model described in Section 4.2). Moreover, the user can visualize the extent of the spread of WNV on the map in different ways. The system can either change the color of the particles representing the infected crows or the color of the polygon representing a municipality containing a high density of infected Culex.",

In the current experiments, we modeled the interactions between crows and mosquitoes as described in the previous section. Since surveillance systems provide data about crows as indicator birds, we used this species to set the simulation parameters and to calibrate the system. However, we added other bird species in the simulation to increase \"the biting opportunities\" for mosquitoes, so that the \"crow population\" does not become extinct by the end of the simulation period.

This population of generic birds appears in the mathematical model with similar equations as those used for the crows (each bird population is represented by a different index j in the equations: see Figure 12b in section 4.2). However, the parameters for each bird family may be different. Due to lack of data, we currently set some average parameters to the equations of the \"generic birds\". Getting more accurate parameters will require further research from bird specialists. In the simulation, one distinction that we established between crows and \"generic birds\" is that we assumed that birds do not move outside the municipality (as crows may do while flying away from the roosts). Hence, generic birds stay in contact with the same mosquito population during the simulation. Indeed, this is a simplification. Since our system is parameterised, we will be able to introduce parameters for other bird species as soon more precise data will be available with respect to the ecology and epidemiology of other birds affected by WNV.",

Hence, our approach is somewhat different from more traditional simulations used for prediction purposes [19]. The WNV-MAGS System simulates the WNV epidemics and enables a user to specify scenarios in order to explore various situations including climate change and different intervention strategies. The user may choose one among four different scenarios which influence the dynamics of the Culex population (Figure 6). The first scenario is the default scenario which can be set in order to use average conditions of temperature and precipitations (using in this case the Canadian Climate Normals [20]). In order to estimate the number of mosquitoes located in each municipality, we computed the number of sumps that are along the municipality's roads (see section 4.3). Sumps offer ideal locations for the maturation of larvae and the emergence of adult mosquitoes. They are also the main targets of larvicide spraying. But abundant rains may flush sumps, killing a large proportion of larvae. In a second type of scenario, the user can choose a date during which abundant rains may flush sumps in some municipalities (Figure 7). In the same way, the third scenario is used to simulate the use of larvicides in a certain area (municipality). The last scenario is a combination of the second and third scenarios. Hence, it is possible to choose a date for the flushing of sumps and another date for the application of larvicides. Most larvae are supposed to die after the flushing of a sump, although the dynamics of the larval populations starts all over again since there are always Culex adults in the vicinity of the sump that will spawn new eggs. Moreover, the WNV-MAGS System offers a variety of functionalities to the user in order to modify the parameters of the mathematical model, to visualize the progress of the infection in and around the crows' roosts, to extract data from the simulation and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the involved populations.",

We had to consider these averages because we do not have sufficient data from the field (trap measurements are sparse and not carried out regularly in Quebec municipalities). Moreover, these data averages enabled us to adjust our initial data in the simulation (mainly the initial number of mosquitoes) as it can be observed in Figure 8a. The simulation curve and the real data curve fit nicely between July 1st and August 15th. The two big drops that are observed in the real data curve are difficult to explain at this point since we consider the average measures over four years. This may be the result of systematic larvicide applications in July and August (3 applications in some municipalities during a WNV season), but we have no sufficient data to confirm this conjecture. In figure 8b, we also observe a similarity between the curves representing the infected mosquitoes. Again, the rugged red curve represents averages of real data over 2003\u20132006.

Moreover, we used a multi-agent geosimulation approach which takes into account the influence of the geographic characteristics of the various regions, thanks to the use of GIS data. For example, we determined the geo-referenced co-ordinates of crows' roosts in order to locate them on the map and we were able to develop rules which control the expansion/contraction of roosts over space and time. We also pre-processed climate data in a GIS in order to feed it to the simulation. We also used the geographic characteristics and the location of favourable habitats for mosquitoes in order to represent the populations of Culex using an intelligent density map. Consequently, we were able to implement the interactions between the mosquitoes' and birds' populations which can cause an outbreak of the virus and epidemic propagation of the disease. Even if other works [26,27] also used GIS data to simulate the spread of the WNV, they did not offer a decision support system as we do. In contrast, our system enables users to simulate the propagation of WNV under various short-term climate scenarios and allows for local parameterization. This approach may be useful for practical decision-making. For instance, it has been shown [28] that the number of degree-days below -5\u00b0C in the winter and the number of degree-days greater than 25\u00b0C in the summer may contribute to a highly epidemic emergence of the virus during the summer under specific climatic conditions. Consequently, our system may be used to predict such an epidemic if we simulate the propagation of the WNV using a scenario in which seasonal forecasts of climatic data are favourable for the emergence of the virus [29]. By assessing the simulation results and comparing the outcomes of different intervention scenarios, the users of the WNV-MAGS System can make more informed decisions about the actions to be taken such as the application of larvicides or the stepping up of personal protection measures.",

The third part (processes P7 and P8) deals with the interactions between the sub-populations of crows and the sub-populations of Culex. It reflects the interactions between the agents' roosts and the intelligent density map. The last part (processes P9 to P12) is responsible for the management of scenarios, as well as for the display, analyses and calibration of the results. We used different databases (as presented in Section 4.3) in order to initialize the populations of Culex and crows at time t0 (beginning of the simulation). We used these populations to compute the dynamics of crows, the dynamics of Culex and the interactions between the two populations while increasing the time by one step, at time t. Then, we get the new populations at time t+1 (taking into account the state changes of the sub-populations of mosquitoes and crows reflecting the infection spread and deaths) and the system triggers again the same processes to simulate the joint evolution of the two populations. The simulation results can then be displayed on the map. Domain specialists can also calibrate the simulation using the WNV surveillance data (that we have pre-processed). The user can manipulate the results and create various scenarios. Then, the simulation results can be assessed and compared.",

To this end, we selected the model proposed by Wonham and colleagues [16] to compute the dynamics of the two populations. This model is based on 8 differential equations (Figure 12a) which can compute over time the evolution of the different categories of individuals (called 'compartments'): susceptible,infected, recovered and dead birds, the larvae of mosquitoes and the susceptible, exposed and infected adult mosquitoes. We proposed some modifications in order to correct some discrepancies that we found in the model. We also included climate effects in the model using the work of Madder and colleagues [33] as a starting point. This was a difficult task because the model was no longer in equilibrium and this required several modifications to the differential equations [18]. Figure 12b presents an overview of the new equations of the proposed model. We notice that the birds equations (dSBJ/dt, dIBJ/dt, dRBJ/dt, dXBJ/dt) have an index j which represents a different bird species that we want to include in the simulation. Climate effects are computed using another set of equations that is not presented in this paper. These equations modify certain parameters in the differential equations of Figure 12b. For example vxL in the dLM/dt equation represents the rate of progress of larvae toward the state of nymphae, this rate depends on temperature conditions defined in a different set of equations. The adjusted model gives satisfactory results in terms of quality (e.g. distribution of the mosquitoes' generations). Indeed, the pace of the established curves reflects the biological behaviours of the studied species if we refer to the specialized literature. However, the quantitative results (e.g. the number of larvae, eggs, emerged Culex, dead crows, etc.) had not been conclusive with the first results of the simulation. We corrected this problem with the calibration of the system as presented in Section 2.4.",

We computed an average of the number of individuals in the case of several records of the same roost (same latitude and same longitude). This data is used to characterise the roost agents (Table 3).

We then computed the number of sumps in each municipality by using the total length of roads (Table 4). We assumed that there is an average of one sump for each 30 linear meters of road. This average distance conforms to the standards used by the Minist\u00e8re des transports du Qu\u00e9bec (MTQ) when they install sumps.

This default value can also be modified by the user as well as the average number of Culex adults which emerge from a sump at the beginning of a simulation.
