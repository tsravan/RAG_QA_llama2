The biological relevance of ACE2 reflects its critical location in the enzymatic cascade of the renin-angiotensin system to directly govern the local expression of angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang-(1-7), two bioactive hormones with significant and opposing actions.",

In comparison with normal controls, patients with overt vasculopathy expressed significantly higher amounts of ACE2 protein in the circulation. These patients, however, exhibited reduced ACE2 activity in serum and circulating autoantibodies against the enzyme. There are few reports on the circulating levels of ACE2 in humans or experimental models, possibly reflecting the difficulty of obtaining a consistent measurement of the enzymatic activity. The current study reveals a potentially novel mechanism to attenuate the catalytic activity of ACE2, thereby promoting the inflammatory actions of Ang II.",

In contrast to ACE, which cleaves two amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus of Ang I to form Ang II, ACE2 hydrolyzes a single amino acid from the carboxyl end of Ang II to form Ang-(1-7) [2]. ACE is considered the primary enzymatic pathway that catalyzes the generation of Ang II in the circulation and tissues. ACE inhibitors, which have become standard therapies in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease, have little or no inhibitory activity against ACE2, but they reduce the metabolism of Ang-(1-7) [2]. Circulating levels of ACE activity are readily measurable in humans and other species using synthetic substrates or assessing the direct conversion of Ang I to Ang II.",

Nevertheless, families with detectable circulating ACE2 exhibited a greater incidence of cardiovascular pathologies although the overall sample population was low. More recent studies by Epelman and colleagues find that circulating levels of ACE2 are highly associated with increasing severity of progressive heart failure [4].

Pre-eclampsia is associated with circulating autoantibodies against the AT1 protein that act as functional receptor agonists to promote vasoconstriction and inflammation [5]. Studies by Harrison and colleagues suggest that T-cell expression of the AT1 receptor contributes to inflammatory events and the development of hypertension. Moreover, activated T cells may themselves generate Ang II locally to influence cell function in an autocrine manner [6]. In experimental encephalo myelitis, AT1 expression was increased and subsequent AT1 receptor blockade or ACE inhibition ameliorated the autoimmune inflammation [7].",

Increased circulating levels of ACE2 may reflect a compensatory mechanism to alter the balance of the renin-angiotensin system to favor the ACE2- Ang-(1-7)-AT7 receptor axis and promote the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory actions of the hepta-peptide, as well as attenuate the Ang II-AT1 receptor pathway. Clearly, generation of endogenous antibodies with inhibitory activity against ACE2 may undermine this compensatory response. Indeed, identification of endogenous ACE2 inhibitors is important in lieu of optimizing the therapeutic benefits following administration of recombinant soluble ACE2, as recently demonstrated in models of diabetic nephropathy [8] and liver fibrosis [9] or in the genetic expression of ACE2 in pulmonary hypertension [10].",
