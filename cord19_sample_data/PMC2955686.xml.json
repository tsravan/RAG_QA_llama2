There is no gold standard for diagnosing microbial infection as clinical and laboratory signs are neither sensitive nor specific enough, and microbiological studies often remain negative. The presence of a new infiltrate on plain chest radiograph is considered indicative for diagnosing pneumonia, especially when is supported by clinical and laboratory findings. However it is difficult to differentiate a chest infiltrate of bacterial origin from a chest infiltrate of non-bacterial origin solely based on radiological criteria [1]. The diagnosis of infection is not always clear in the acute setting in patients with respiratory tract disease and a surrogate marker of infection would be a major benefit in the diagnostic armamentarium. Many inflammatory mediators and acute phase reactants, like C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, have been described as reliable markers of infection; however none are specific enough, since they are also increased in non-infectious inflammatory conditions [2].",

It behaves like a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) since its activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) and of interleukin (IL)-8. Although its ligand is still unknown, activation is mediated by bacteria and fungi [3,4]. A soluble form of TREM-1, namely sTREM-1, is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) [5,6], and in the serum of patients with sepsis, with bacterial meningitis and with acute pancreatitis [7-12]. This same soluble form of TREM-1 seems to be increased in patients bearing non-infectious processes like peptic ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, viral infections, malignant pleural effusions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but also among patients after cardiac surgery or cardiac arrest. Increase of sTREM-1 seems particular prominent when the latter non-infectious states are complicated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without infection [13-19].",

Comparisons of sTREM-1 between groups were done by Mann-Whitney U test after Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of sTREM-1 between consecutive days within one group were done by Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) were designed to asses sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the estimated parameters to disclose infectious from non-infectious infiltrates. Patients were divided into two categories according to serum levels of sTREM-1 upon admission: those with sTREM-1 below or equal to 180 pg/ml; and those with serum sTREM-1 greater than 180 pg/ml. This concentration has been proposed as a threshold defining final prognosis in septic populations [22,29]. Since CAP is a common cause of sepsis, this threshold was considered of merit. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and comparisons were done by log-rank test. Correlations between severity scores and measured parameters were done according to Spearman. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

CPIS was introduced for that purpose helping considerable in cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [23]. TREM-1 is a surface receptor on cells of the myeloid lineage. Activation of TREM-1 leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [9,31,32]. Binding of its ligand is possibly linked to the activation of several transcription complexes that synergize with NF-\u03baB in order to elicit transcription of genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines [8]. sTREM-1 is the soluble counterpart of TREM-1 and it is probably shed in the systemic circulation from cell membranes of neutrophils and monocytes [7,33,34]. The physiologic role of sTREM-1 remains under question despite data support a probable anti-inflammatory role [31,35].",

They also disclose a relationship between levels of circulating sTREM-1 and causative pathogens. More precisely, infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Sthaphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were accompanied by greater levels of sTREM-1 and by greater expression of TREM-1 on neutrophils than infections caused by other pathogens. Although it may be hypothesized that Gram-positive cocci and H. influenzae are strong inducers of TREM-1 expression, it should be emphasized that TREM-1 is one PRR, the exact agonist of which remains to be found [29,31].",

Concentrations of sTREM-1 in serum are particularly increased in CAP caused by Gram-positive cocci and Haemophilus species. The real clinical value of sTREM-1 assay comes when TREM-1 levels are low, allowing the clinician to withhold empiric antibiotics until culture results are available, and thus eliminating unnecessary antibiotic exposure to the patient. And finally, early serum levels of sTREM-1 greater than 180 pg/ml in CAP are associated with unfavourable prognosis.",
