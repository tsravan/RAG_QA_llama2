For long-term storage, dried blood spots were stored at 4 \u00b0C. DNA extraction from Guthrie cards was performed with the Generation Capture Card Kit (Gentra Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines for DNA purification and elution. DNA was extracted from whole blood by use of the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems) or the Whatman FTA system (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ). All genomic DNAs from these preparations were diluted 1:10 in water, and 1\u03bcL was added to each PCR reaction (1\u201350 ng of total DNA). As a cross-reference and in the prospective study, genotypes were also determined by CF Gold linear array or DNA sequencing if discrepancies were detected.",

Each EraCode sequence was separately coupled to a specific color-coded fluorescent microsphere type (Luminex Corp). Each microsphere type contains a unique color or signature that can be determined by the Luminex100.

During TSE, TiTaq incorporates labels on extenders only when specific targets having 5\u2032 iCs are present. The nonnatural base pair formed by iG and iC has been successfully used for both molecular recognition (13)(14)(15) and for site-specific enzymatic incorporation (16)(17)(18). To date, we have covalently coupled a series of different reporter groups to diGTP, using succinimidyl ester chemistry and confirmed enzymatic incorporation into nucleic acids by use of several commercially available polymerases (data beyond the scope of this report). In many cases, single amplicons spanning regions that incorporated multiple mutations were used as templates for multiple extenders. After TSE, EraCode-labeled beads and streptavidin-phycoerythrin were added, and the reactions were analyzed on the Luminex100. Data are reported in median fluorescence intensity (MFI).",

For the first step, regions of the target of interest are amplified by PCR using primers that contain a single 5\u2032-iC. In the second step, the amplicons from the first step are used as templates for the TSEs, and iC directs specific diGTP-biotin incorporation. The TSEs are coded on their 5\u2032 ends with sequences that specifically recognized short complementary sequences (EraCodes) attached to an addressed solid matrix. The molecular recognition of any given code with its EraCode is specific enough so that increased temperatures, incubation steps, or washings are not required (typical requirements for hybridization capture using only naturally occurring base chemistries). During this second step, labels are placed site specifically on the TSEs. This process requires the presence of iC-containing amplicons that are complementary to the TSE. When the correct target is available, the extension reaction continues to the 5\u2032 end of the amplicon, where the diGTP-biotin is used to insert the biotin into the TSE. Specificity and signal consistency arise when coded TSEs are covalently attached to a single biotin reporter in the presence of the correct target. In the final step, the TSEs are captured on the solid matrix and detected. The presence of the target is then determined by where the reporters are located spatially on the liquid matrix (created by the differentially colored microspheres).",

Specifically, we believe that there are many reasons that the extra base pair is beneficial. For example, we used short code sequences in the capture step to decode the complex extension mixtures. This may be possible with code sets constructed from only A, G, C, or T, but optimization would surely be more difficult because of cross-hybridization with sequence complements or close complements found in nature. The additional informational content that iC:iG builds into DNA also allows for greater diversity when compared with their all-natural counterparts. Specifically, if the four naturally occurring bases are used to make a library of 10mers, there are 410, or 106 possibilities. In contrast, a six-letter system generates 610, or 108 unique 10mers. As demonstrated here, specific assembly can occur at conditions such as room temperature, which is in effect more amenable to and simplifies molecular diagnostics.",

These short DNA codes are simple to produce, specifically hybridize at room temperature, do not require wash steps, can be amplified with standard polymerases, and do not cross-hybridize with natural DNA.
