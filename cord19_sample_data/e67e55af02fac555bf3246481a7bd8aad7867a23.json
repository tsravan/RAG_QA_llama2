It is applied today to the study of zoonotic disease and interventions in rural agricultural communities that share close living arrangements between people and their families, their pastoral work environment, and the animals for which they care. A recent movement in the United States, the \"Medicine and Public Health\" initiative (http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/mph/) recognized that human clinical medicine and public health communities had developed parallel but separate enterprises and there was a need to reassess this division. Medicine (focusing primarily on the health of individuals) and Public Health (with a population perspective) needed to find innovative and joint solutions to improve the health of the people of the United States. Similar schisms are evident between veterinary medicine and the agricultural industry in the United States and initiatives are underway to bridge these gaps. Integration of the two concepts of one-medicine and nidality provides an opportunity to apply a systems approach to dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases in today's global agricultural and industrial settings.",

The presentation of information needed to raise a clinician's awareness for the early diagnosis of a bioterrorism incident was considered by many to be esoteric, an unlikely scenario, and not relevant to the daily practice of medicine in the United States.",

Texas has enzootic foci of anthrax, tularemia, and plague. Mosquito-borne encephalitides such as Saint Louis Encephalitis, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, Western Equine Encephalitis, and most recently West Nile Virus occur in our geographic region. We have had cases of hemorrhagic fever (Ebola alice) in primate colonies in Texas. Dengue is endemic in countries immediately to our south. Vibrio species infections are identified in association with our seafood and shellfish industry in the Gulf of Mexico. It is not unusual for sporadic human cases of infection with these organisms to be diagnosed by clinicians in Texas. The teaching challenge was to accomplish our goal of \"heightened awareness\" for agents of bioterrorism and also make the seminars relevant to the daily practice of medicine (4).",

Instead of considering the biological niche of the organism in nature, however, I chose to define the agent's nidality from an epidemiological perspective. Every organism that causes disease in human populations has an expected epidemiologic presentation. The epidemiologic pattern provides clues as to whether the clinical presentation is \"expected\" or \"un-expected\" in that physician's range of practice experience. A corollary to the expected/un-expected clinical paradigm is the potential route of exposure to the organism in a particular geographic and/or occupational setting (6) . Routes of exposure can be categorized as \"natural\" or \"un-natural\" and may in fact influence the constellation of signs and symptoms observed by the clinician. I now employ these concepts in teaching and instructional activities to prepare health care providers in biodefense preparation and response.",

Bacillus anthracis occupies a natural ecologic niche in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. The number of individuals involved in each scenario was small. The clinical presentations followed classical expectations. The epidemiologic picture matched the clinical presentation. Thus, the information presented to my clinical audience was relevant to their practice of medicine today in the state of Texas and hopefully raised their level of knowledge regarding the natural history of one of the potential agents of bioterrorism. I conclude with \"clues\" to understanding how the epidemiologic picture may differ if the anthrax exposures were man-made and intentional rather than a part of what is expected in our part of the world: the epidemiology would be wrong; there would be large numbers of human cases; there may be concomitant deaths of other animal species; and, there may be unusual strains of the organism.",
