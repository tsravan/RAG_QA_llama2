Raw samples such as blood or urine can be directly applied onto the sensor chip (Fig. 1C). Unlike previously reported electrochemical DNA sensors that used graphite or carbon electrodes, we use a single layer of gold for all three electrodes, i.e., working, auxiliary, and reference electrodes. Typically, Ag/AgCl or a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) is used as the reference electrode so that reversible oxidation/reduction occurs at a fixed potential at the reference electrode. In contrast, we use Au as the reference electrode because its properties of malleability and durability simplify fabrication and allow use of extremely thin electrodes. In our particular application, where the reduction of a mediator is monitored, Au can be successfully used as the reference electrode because a low voltage difference is maintained for short periods of time. The Au/Au/Au electrode system is characterized by cyclic voltammetry and targets are detected by amperometry.",

A second blocker is bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is added to the probe solution and mixed with the sample prior to introduction onto the sensor surface. BSA coats the SAM, reducing background by decreasing non-specific binding to the sensor surface. The third blocker is casein, which is included with our enzyme solution.

These potentials are chosen so that they bracket the formal potential, E\n0, of the analyte. At the initial potential, no significant current flows. Once the potential is stepped to the final potential, the analyte is consumed at the electrode surface via oxidation or reduction (depending on the direction of the step). This depletes the concentration of the analyte near the electrode. The current response is thus a rapid increase followed by decay as the analyte is depleted and equilibrium is reached. The analysis of chronoamperometry or amperometry data is based on the Cottrell equation, which defines the current\u2013time dependence for linear diffusion control. The final bias potential is determined such that the baseline current generated from electrolyte oxidation or reduction is minimized. This yields a better signal-to-noise ratio since the majority of background noise is from the electrolyte baseline.",

Negative control (NC) readings were taken from a sample without bacteria. As shown, readings for E. coli were significantly greater than those for the five other species of uropathogenic bacteria tested (P\n < 0.0001).",
