            "text": "This work is related to several threads within modeling and simulation. Giro et al. [1] proposed detailed discrete modeling of ecosystems; Ginovart et al. [2] developed INDISIM, a discrete simulation of bacterial colonies; Eubank et al. [3] and Barret et al. [4] discuss EpiSims-related work [5]. EpiSims is a Los Alamos project for discrete modeling of epidemics in cities, starting with Portland, Oregon. It was developed in relationship to the TRANSIM model for understanding movements of people in cities. According to press releases, there is similar work at Emory University aimed at developing a model of disease in hypothetical American communities of 2,000 to 48,000 people [6]. Johns Hopkins University has a program that has been funded to accomplish similar goals [7]. A number of authors including Schinazi [8], Aparicio et al. [9] and others [10,11] have explored clustering in the real world and its relevance to the spread of disease, as well as theoretical models. EpiFlex has modeled communities with multiple demographics linked by transport corridors for population sizes up to 3.5 million. This is not the limit; large models can be quite slow to execute, but EpiFlex can be scaled up given enough computing resources. This will happen to some degree as Moore's law provides faster computers with more memory. Additionally, the internal architecture of EpiFlex was designed with parallelization of modules in mind, so it should be fairly straightforward to do modify given resources. However, some of the more interesting results are obtained from lower order population sizes where \"small world networks\" [11,12] can have interesting impacts, and models can show differences in morbidity linked to population size. Watts has criticized mathematical models as inadequate to show real world variation in epidemics [13].",

R0 is a composite value describing the behavior of an infectious agent. Hence, R0 can be decomposed classically, for example, as: p d c, where p is probability of infection occurring for a contact, d is duration of infectiousness, and c is number of contacts[17].",

They suggested that a model dealing with demographics and their subgroups would be useful and described a start toward conceiving such a model, creating a matrix of SIRP flows for each demographic group within a \"city\" and modeling contacts between these groups. Thus, the possibility of building an entirely discrete model using the object-oriented approach, essentially setting the granularity of the Hyman-LaForce concept at the level of the individual, together with Monte Carlo method, was attractive. The object method of design seemed to be a good fit, since object-oriented programming was invented for discrete simulations [24]. An Object-Oriented (OO) design defines as its primitive elements \"black box\" subunits that have defined ways of interacting with each other [25].",

This slowing is an expected characteristic of an object modeling system and is the price paid for the discrete detail of the EpiFlex model. The primary source of this increase in processing time is the sum of series of possible infectious events that are modeled for each iteration. It therefore scales as a series sum not as a log, based on the contagiousness of the disease and the number of potential hosts in a location with an infected host. This is minimized by only processing infectious host contacts. The increase stems from the characteristics of networks in which each node has n connections to other nodes. When iteration is done for a location containing infectable hosts, it is the number of infected hosts that creates an element of the series. The infected hosts are put into a list, and each one interacts randomly with other hosts (including other infected ones) in the location. Thus, considered as a network with m nodes, each of the m nodes is a host. A temporary connection to another host is made to n other nodes where n <m, and n<k. The value of k is determined by a randomized input that returns the number of contacts of this infected host in this location. Consequently, the series consists of all the temporary connections made for contact modeling for each cycle.",

This effect is most striking when very small populations in the order of 1,000 are examined. Literature data regarding this in real world populations are sparse. However, there are indications from historical accounts of small populations in the new world that a link between population size and morbidity is observable in real world populations [38-43].

Since very small populations will mostly function within the window when there is no host immunity, the infection will spread to a larger fraction. This effect has public health implications because, clearly, the structure of the network is highly significant in determining the likelihood that an infected host will contact na\u00efve hosts.

This makes intuitive sense, because there is lower probability that a subpopulation of susceptible hosts will become large when there are more attempts to infect them. Similarly, in a system of cities interconnected by transport linkages, later peaks tend to be smaller and more variable than earlier ones. This is due to two things. First, a degree of low-grade infection linking back through the system provides a higher total level of infection events in the whole system than the formally defined initiating disease vector. Second, as time passes, the mix of immune versus susceptible becomes unsynchronized for the population as a whole, since hosts that escaped infection during one epidemic may be infected during the next, and some whose immunity has declined may also become infected. Thus, it is expected that we would see the development of a complex non-repeating waveform with some similarity. This type of waveform is what EpiFlex shows with longer simulations in large populations, as illustrated in Figure 8.",

The significance of this for modeled epidemics, particularly in the light of recent work [17], is that in some cases (the proportion would be expected to vary in rough accordance with R0) the infection dies out owing to random chance.

The EpiFlex results shown using a simplified city configuration of 35 major airline hub cities, with a total 3.5 million population among all 35 cities, shows a propagation wave of 1.8 weeks. While this is shorter than real world data, several factors account for the difference. First, in the current EpiFlex \"vanilla\" configuration, the transport network is flat in terms of the numbers of persons moved from city to city. Second, each city contains the same population of only 100,000 due to practical limitations. For the propagation histogram of Figure 9a, 1000 manifesting cases or more was used as the data point.

EpiFlex has capabilities that were not discussed owing to time and space constraints. This system is effective in duplicating the kind of multimodality and apparent stochastic variation [13] that are seen in real populations. EpiFlex results can provoke thought about the nature of epidemics and infectious disease spread in interesting ways by providing an experimental test environment that is not as abstracted from its subject as most mathematical models are.",

This immunity declines, in the case of influenza, over a period of roughly 2 years, with a steep drop-off beginning after the first year, and hence is termed partial immunity(P). (It is not actually the case that the immune system's response to influenza antigens degrades so rapidly; rather, the virus mutates rapidly, and host immunity declines. The net result is similar.) This decline in immunity models the real world antigenic mutation of influenza viruses. In a more perfect model, the influenza virus would change and multiple viruses would be modeled. At some point the immunity declines so that it is effectively zero in the model (which corresponds to large antigenic change) and the person is returned to the fully susceptible(S) population. A person can become reinfected (diagonal arrow), though their probability of reinfection is lower, during this period of declining immunity.",

Use of the slider allows one to \"eyeball\" the asymptotic curve to approximate what seems reasonable.

It makes sense to do this because data in this area are fairly sparse, and one may want to perform multiple runs with slightly different immune drop characteristics.
