The human PSGs are comprised of a leader peptide followed by one N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region-like domain (N-domain) and two or three Ig constant region-like domains [5]. PSG homologues have been identified in species with hemochorial placentation, including nonhuman primates, rats, and mice, all of which are species having several PSG genes that result in expression of several PSG proteins because of alternative splicing [6]. The function of human and murine PSGs is believed to be that of immunomodulators, as one of many reported mechanisms that prevent rejection of the allogeneic fetus by the maternal immune system. This proposed role of PSGs has been suggested by several investigators and is supported by different experimental findings, including the ability of PSGs to induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) [2, 7\u201310].",

The recognized importance of TGFB1 during the angiogenic process has been strengthened by its ability to regulate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, which includes VEGFs A, B, C, and D as well as placental growth factor (PGF) [13\u201316]. Therefore, we hypothesized that PSGs may induce TGFB1 to promote immune tolerance, affect trophoblast function, and promote angiogenesis in the pregnant uterus. We explored this possibility by examining the effect of PSG1 in cell types involved with development of the placental blood supply, including primary monocyte/macrophages, low-passage primary endothelial cells, and two extravillous trophoblast cell lines.",

The studies reported here indicate that amino acids G93 and D95, corresponding to the first and third amino acids in this potential receptor binding region, respectively, are not essential for the PSG1 functions we have described, whereas mutations in the salt bridge of the N-domain and elimination of two potential N-linked glycosylation sites render a protein without activity.",

Angiogenesis occurs at all stages during pregnancy to ensure that the embryo will be supplied with sufficient nutrients and oxygen [22, 23]. The results presented here suggest that PSGs could contribute to the process of establishing the maternal-fetal vasculature in two ways. First, PSG1 has the ability to induce TGFB1 and VEGFA by different cell types, including monocytes/macrophages and extravillous trophoblasts. Second, PSG1 has the capacity to interact with endothelial cells, inducing tube formation, as well as to enhance vascular morphogenetic processes induced by VEGFA.",

Five hours posttransfection, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were kept in OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 72 h. The recombinant PSG1 G93D95-SL mutant, designated PSG1gdd\u2192sdl, and the PSG1 R64N70N77-AAA mutant, designated PSG1rnn\u2192aaa, were purified from the media using a protein A column as described above for wild-type PSG1-Fc.

Afterward, they were stimulated with PSG1-Fc or the control protein (FLAG-Fc) alone or in combination with VEGFA.

The N-terminal domain of most human PSGs, with the exception of PSG1, PSG4, and PSG8, contain an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif [18]. This motif is on the FG loop, which is solvent exposed and considered to be a biologically important element in CEACAM1. PSG1 has the sequence GDD rather than RGD, but the importance of this region for receptor binding and activity for all PSGs has been frequently cited [19, 20]. To investigate the possible importance of this region of the PSG1 protein, we mutated the G at position 93 and the D at position 95 to S and L, respectively. We selected the amino acids S and L based on their presence in the corresponding position in human CEACAM3. These changes are not expected to affect the folding of the protein while being substantially different from the amino acids present in wild-type PSG1. Like wild-type PSG1-Fc, the resulting protein has an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa (Fig. 7A). The PSG1gdd\u2192sdl mutant was compared to the wild-type protein for its ability to induce TGFB1 in HTR-8/SVneo, monocytes, and HEEC. Our results show that the PSG1gdd\u2192sdl mutant induced TGFB1 over control protein (Fig. 7B).",

These potential N-linked glycosylation sites are also conserved in all mouse PSGs and in the majority of baboon and rat PSGs. Because the importance of N-linked glycosylation and the putative salt bridge has never been explored, we introduced three mutations that render a protein without the conserved N-linked glycosylation sites and the ability to form the salt bridge.

Even at later stages of pregnancy, the placental vasculature continues to be remodeled to enable blood flow to the increasing metabolic demands of the fetus. Sufficient uteroplacental blood flow requires remodeling of the spiral arteries by the extravillous trophoblasts [43]. Failure of spiral artery remodeling has been associated with complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction [44\u201346].

Therefore, we decided to investigate whether PSG1 induces the expression of different members of the VEGF family. When exploring the possible induction by PSG1 of VEGFC in HTR-8/SVneo cells and of PGF in BeWo cells, we found that these cells express very high basal levels of these growth factors and that whereas we saw significant induction in some experiments, this induction was not reproducible in others.

The cells used in our in vitro studies most likely do not exactly replicate the phenotype of placental macrophages, but we propose that PSGs could be one of the placental products, which increases the secretion of VEGFA by these cells. Whereas we found that monocyte-derived dendritic cells secreted TGFB1 in response to PSG1 treatment, VEGFA secretion was not induced. Recent reports indicate that uterine dendritic cells fine-tune decidual angiogenesis by producing TGFB1 and secreted FLT1 and that they have an important role in vascular development [49, 54]. Interestingly, only alternative activation\u2014not TGFB1 treatment\u2014was reported to lead to VEGFA production by dendritic cells [55]. Therefore, it remains to be investigated whether, in the decidual microenvironment, PSG1 may induce dendritic cells to secrete VEGFA.",

PSG1 induced endothelial cell tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. When VEGFA was added to the cells together with PSG1, we observed that the network was enhanced over the cells in which PSG1 or VEGFA was added alone. Further experiments are required to determine the molecular and signaling mechanisms by which PSG1 induces endothelial tube formation. Tube formation likely is not the result of induction of VEGFA by PSG1, because we did not observe significant PSG1-mediated VEGFA secretion in endothelial cells at PSG1 concentrations employed in the tube assays. Additionally, we did not observe an increase in endothelial cell migration upon PSG1 treatment, which would be expected as a result of up-regulation of VEGFA. Therefore, while PSG1 may increase the availability of VEGFA in the placenta, the effect on endothelial cells, because of its ability to induce VEGFA secretion from other cell types, may be of a paracrine nature or could be mediated by the observed up-regulation of TGFB1. PSGs belong to the CEA family, and it is interesting to note that other members of this family, which are membrane bound, have been implicated in the processes of immunoregulation, human trophoblast invasion, and angiogenesis [27, 56\u201361].",

At 200 \u03bcg/ml, PSGs are the most abundant fetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream during late pregnancy [62]. At this time, and to our knowledge, no specific antibodies can distinguish the different members of the human PSG family, but splice variants for most of them have been reported to be expressed, with most of these including the N-domain [19]. Recently, transcripts for PSG1 were found in sperm, and PSG1 protein was detected during zygotic development, suggesting a possible role for this protein in the early stages of embryogenesis and/or implantation [63]. Within the N-domain, most PSGs have an RGD or an RGD-like sequence. The RGD motif forms the minimal functional binding unit in some integrin ligands [64], and its presence in one of the solvent-exposed loops of most PSGs was assumed to be required for PSG function [20]. Within this sequence, the conservation of the aspartic acid (D) at position 95 has been cited as essential for function [18, 19]. Our results indicate that at least for some functions of PSGs, the G in position 93 and the D at position 95 are not essential. Binding assays showed that although the PSG1gdd\u2192sdl mutant binds to target cells, such as HTR-8/SVneo, significantly over the control protein, the binding (measured as mean fluorescence intensity) was approximately half that of the wild-type protein. Whether other, as-yet-unknown functions of this protein could be mediated by these amino acids, or how the mutation affects the affinity of the interaction with the receptor, remains to be determined.",

VEGF induces endothelial tubes (A, arrows) as expected, whereas no tubes were seen in the control when the cells were exposed to basal medium only (B). Addition of PSG1-Fc to basal media induces endothelial tubes (C, arrows) and also supports VEGF-induced tube formation (D, arrows). Original magnification \u00d7450.",
