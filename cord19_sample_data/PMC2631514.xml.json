Among the test organisms, it was most active against M.smegmatis, 20% more than the standard antibiotic, streptomycin 10 \u03bcg (Student's t-test, P = 0.001) (Table 2). The boiled extract of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis had comparable antimicrobial activities to those of streptomycin 10 \u03bcg (Student's t-test, P = 0.279). These data suggest that Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis may be a potential agent to treat infections caused by M. smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [40]. It was reported that magnolol and honokiol exhibited antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci [33], Propionibacterium sp [32] and periodontal pathogens [34]. Therefore, disk diffusion test was carried out on magnolol and honokiol individually and in combination (Table 2). The one way ANOVA on the four treatment groups namely streptomycin, honokiol, magnolol and combination of magnolol and honokiol (1:1) demonstrated a significant difference between groups (P = 0.001).
