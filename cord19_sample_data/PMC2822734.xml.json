GAD contains curated information on candidate gene studies and more recently on genome wide association studies. It builds on the curation of the CDC HuGENet info literature database [3] in part by adding molecular and ontological annotation creating a bridge between epidemiological and molecular information. This allows the large-scale integration of disease based genetic association information with genomic and molecular information as well as with the software tools and computational approaches and that use genomic information [7-12]. This report is a summary and analysis of the genes and diseases with positive associations in the Genetic Association Database with regard to replication, comparisons between diseases, and within broad phenotypic disease classes. Although GAD contains information on gene variation, this report is at the gene level only and does not consider specific gene variation or genetic polymorphism.",

Similarly, the gene CFH has been associated with macular degeneration at least 19 times, as well as to the endo-phenotype of macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization 3 times.

This gene overlap emphasizes the fundamental, often step-wise biochemical role each gene plays in shared disease etiology [24-27]. That is, HLA-DQB1 in antigen presentation, CTLA4 in regulation of the expansion of T cell subsets, and PTPN22 in T cell receptor signaling, all contributing to immunological aberrations and progression to clinical disease, as in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes. In other cases, the same gene has been associated with quite different clinical phenotypes, suggesting sharing of complex biological mechanisms at a more underlying level. For example, the gene CFTR, widely recognized as the cause of cystic fibrosis, has been consistently associated with pancreatitis, may be implicated in chronic rhinitis [28], and may play a protective role in gastrointestinal disorders [29].",

Tables 6 and S3 are comparisons of the genes that overlap between the human and mouse gene lists (Table S1 and Table S2) showing mouse gene symbols and their human orthologs. Table 6 is a small subset of selected gene-phenotype cross species comparisons. Even though in some cases the human studies have not been replicated, there is often a striking concordance between human disease phenotypes and mouse genetically determined phenotypes. For example, the human gene inhibin alpha (INHA) has been associated with premature ovarian failure[32], and shows mouse phenotypes of abnormal ovarian follicle morphology, female infertility, and ovarian hemorrhage[33], among other phenotypes relevant to human disease. Similarly, in humans the engrailed homeobox 2 gene (EN2) has been associated with autistic disorder[34] while the comparison to mouse En2 has genetic mutations involved in abnormal social integration, spatial learning, and social/consecutive interaction, among others[35]. Importantly, the few mouse studies highlighted above, and many found in the main table S3, were published after the corresponding human genetic population based epidemiological studies. Given concerns of false positives and publication bias in human genetic association studies, direct comparisons to related mouse phenotypes may provide supporting evidence that a given gene may be relevant to a specific human disease phenotype. Table S3[36] is a full listing of the 1104 shared genes between the human disease and mouse phenotype summaries.",

Unlike previously defined gene sets based on biological pathways or differentially expressed genes[41], GAD disease gene sets are unique in that they are composed of genes that have been previously shown to be both polymorphic and have been determined to be genetically positively associated with a specific disease phenotype in a human population based genetic association study. Similarly, Table S5a[39] the mouse DISEASE/PHENOTYPE-to-Gene list is used as a source for gene sets for mouse phenotypes (MP gene sets) comprised of unique gene based mouse genetic models. These gene set files are currently the largest set of gene set files publicly available and the only gene sets files where each gene is based on direct human or mouse genetic studies.",

            "text": "One aspect of common complex disease is that the development of disease and disease phenotypes quite often present along a broad spectrum of symptoms and share clinical characteristics, endo-phenotypes, or quantitative traits with closely related disorders [25]. This is evident in gene sharing, as mentioned above, and equally in the overlap of biological pathways between related disorders. Using GAD disease gene sets, Venn diagram comparisons among related disorders shows modest gene sharing. However, when gene sets are then placed into biological pathways and compared by Venn analysis, there is a marked increase in the overlap in pathways between related disorders. This was not found in gene sets from unrelated disorders. For example, major autoimmune disorders quite often share endophenotypes of lymphoproliferation, autoantibody production, and alterations in apoptosis, as well as other immune cellular and biochemical aberrations. As shown in Figure 1a, genes that have been positively associated with type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease show a modest overlap. However, when individual gene sets are fitted into biological pathways, then compared for overlap of pathway membership, there is a striking increase in the overlap at the pathway level. This is true in a comparison of gene and pathways for type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity as well (Figure 1b). This pattern of major pathway overlap does not seem to occur between unrelated disorders, such as insulin resistance, rheumatoid arthritis and bipolar disorder (Figure 1c). This disease related sharing at the pathway level suggests common regulatory mechanisms between these disorders and that the original positive associations are not necessarily due to random chance alone.",

            "text": "As archival information grows, analysis of complex molecular and genetic datasets using clustering or network approaches has become increasingly more useful [13,42-45]. Therefore, in addition to comparisons between individual diseases using human and mouse gene sets, we analyzed large gene groups using dendrogram and clustering approaches based on gene sharing between gene sets. Figure 2 shows a broad based dendrogram comparison based on gene sharing between 480 GAD disease gene sets, using gene sets each containing at least 3 genes. A striking feature of this analysis is that at a coarse level, major disease groups cluster together in space demonstrating shared genes between major clinically important disease groups. Disease domains are represented by groups such as cardiovascular disorders, metabolic disorders, cancer, immune and inflammatory disorders, vision, and chemical dependency. At finer detail within a specific broader group, it becomes clear that individual diseases with overlapping phenotypes are found close in space, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. This overlap due to gene sharing recapitulates an overlap in clinical characteristics between these related disorders. Similarly, phenotypes within the metabolic group related to diabetes are closely aligned in space including; insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia. This close apposition of related disease phenotypes and sub-phenotypes at both a coarse and fine level is a consistent feature of the overall display. The human gene sets used in creating this tree diagram can be found in Table S6[46]. It is important to emphasize that this display and the distance relationships between diseases are calculated through an unbiased gene-sharing algorithm independent of disease phenotype labels and not as a result of an imposed logical hierarchy or an ontological annotation system. This grouping of major disease phenotypes based solely on gene sharing provides supporting evidence that the underlying disease based gene sets may have a fundamental relevance to disease and may not be reported in the literature by chance alone.",

This was produced using the same gene sharing algorithm as for the human gene sets in Figure 2. As with the human dendrogram, the mouse tree displays informative groupings at both a coarse and fine level. This tree groups into major groupings nominally assigned as brain development and brain function, embryonic development, cardiovascular, reproduction, inflammation, renal function, bone development, metabolism, and skin/hair development. The identification of major groupings emphasizing developmental processes reflects the emphasis of gene knockouts and developmental models resulting in observable morphological traits and less so with regard to end stage clinical diseases as in the human dendrogram. Like the human dendrogram (Figure 2) discrete major functional groupings in the mouse dendrogram suggests that individual experimental observations are not random. Fundamental complex processes such as metabolism, cardiovascular phenomena, and developmental processes are integrated by extensive sharing of related pliotropic genes. Moreover, like the human tree, fine structure in the mouse tree shows related mouse phenotypes are closely positioned in space. For example, in the metabolism major grouping, the individual phenotypes of body mass, adipose phenotypes, and weight gain are closely positioned. Similarly, in the brain function group, the behavioral phenotypes of anxiety, exploration, and responses to novel objects are found next to one another. This pattern is a fundamental feature of this tree. Like the human tree, the mouse dendrogram shown here is based solely on a gene sharing algorithm using genes assigned to individual phenotypes. It is not based on an imposed predetermined hierarchy or ontology. Importantly, unlike the human tree, the information contained in the mouse tree is derived from individual independent mouse genetic studies and phenotypic observations and not from large case controlled population based epidemiological studies. Controversial issues such as publication bias or study size which confound human genetic association studies are not as relevant here in the context of studies of experimentally determined individual mouse gene knockouts and related studies. The mouse gene sets used in creating this tree diagram can be found in Table S7[47].",

To provide further evidence of disease relevance and biological content contained in both the human and mouse gene sets hierarchical clustering was performed on both human and mouse. Four hundred and eighty human gene sets were clustered producing 46 major disease clusters. In the mouse, clustering was performed on 2067 mouse phenotype gene sets, using gene sets containing at least 3 genes. This resulted in 165 major subgroups of functional phenotypic specificity. Hierarchical clustering is shown for human [Additional file 1 and Additional file 2] and for mouse [Additional file 3 and Additional file 4]. Like the human and mouse dendograms, this hierarchical clustering showed functional disease grouping at both a coarse group level and at a fine level within major phenotypic groupings. These clusters in both human and mouse falling into closely defined broad functional groups as well as closely related clinical, physiological, and developmental phenotypes demonstrates a general pattern of relevance to disease in their original underlying genetic associations. As in the dendrogram displays, this suggests that the genes nominally positively associated to these disorders, drawn from the medical literature, are not pervasively randomly assigned or due to a widespread pattern of random false positives associations.",
