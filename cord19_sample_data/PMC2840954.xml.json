The reliable epidemiological data is, however, available from 1889-1892 pandemic onwards. Though influenza virus was first isolated in 1933, majority of the present day lessons learnt are based on epidemiological findings from 1918-1919, 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 pandemics[5]. At least two of these pandemics of the 20th century were associated with the re-emergence of such viruses similar to those which were circulated in previous eras, a process referred to as antigenic recycling[6] [Table 1].",

It is important to understand that evolution of Avian Flu pathogen capable of affecting humans will be inherently unpredictable, even though emerging pathogens tend to share some common traits. In case of direct transmission through RNA viruses, it was anticipated that they were most likely to jump between host species.[8] However, the spread of H5N1 virus from human to human transmission has not been observed in India.[9\u201310]",

Though community awareness and its active participation might reduce the number of incidences towards development of severity a combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the households and targeted use of vaccines and specific anti-viral therapies appear to be highly effective and feasible.[17\u201318]",

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) does not cause any illness in domestic poultry while an H5 or H7 LPAI strain posses significant potential to evolve into a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain.[19] HPAI is frequently fatal to domestic poultry and wild birds as it is easily transmissible between the susceptible species. The migration potential among different species across geographical boundaries led to the possibility of emergence of avian influenza virus as human influenza virus with a significant pandemic potential. Such jumps have already threatened species including lesser white-fronted goose, red-breasted goose, swan goose, oriental stork, Siberian crane and bar-headed goose. Recent reports from swine to human transmission have opened the pandemic potential of the virus.[11]",

It started on March 17, 2009 and affected 363 rural backyard poultry. Epidemiological investigation, culling within an area of three-km-radius and continued surveillance will be carried out in an area of 10-km-radius. There were reports of HPAI outbreaks in poultry in Darjeeling and Dakshin Dinajpur, Coochbehar districts of West Bengal and Ravongla district of Sikkim of India in January-February 2009. So far, no cases of human avian influenza have been reported from India. Last two years have seen a series of incidences in Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tripura and other parts of North-East. Due to the nonavailability of track and trace mechanisms, mass culling or killing happens when detected. In 2006 itself, Rs. 2200 crore have been lost. The porous borders, supply chain inefficiencies and inadequate infrastructure make it a regional level issue. The integrity of supply chain with adequate awareness strategy is an important mitigation strategy.[24]",

If the H5N1 virus acquires human-to-human transmissibility with its present fatality rate of more than 50%, the resulting pandemic would be akin to a global \u2018tsunami\u2019. The present volume, speed, and reach of travel has accelerated the spread of infectious diseases as observed in the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which spread to eight countries around the world in just a matter of weeks.[25] Such a deadly impact will not affect only the young population as in 1918.[26] The severe impact can spread to other sectors of the population including the old which is equally active outside the household boundaries and thereby equally vulnerable to be exposed.[25] In view of such a devastating potential, it is pertinent to develop national and regional plans complementary to the various pandemic periods illustrated by WHO [Figure 2].

Such vaccination leads to the formation of memory B cells generating antibodies against the virus which will destroy the virus directly.[50] The limitation is that development of any specific vaccine requires time and delay which will continuously add up millions of deaths. It is important to understand that the existing variants of influenza virus are being tested on the common traits which, predictably, may not mutate while attaining potential to affect human population. The vaccination program using these vaccines might be effective or may not work at all. One common misconception about flu vaccination is that it prevents infection with flu entirely. This is not so. Flu infection occurs even if one has been successfully vaccinated against that strain of flu. The patients may have some mild common cold symptoms or may not have any symptoms at all.[51] However, if the mutation is highly lethal and existing vaccines like sanofi pasture H5N1 avian flu vaccine and others do not work against the offspring virus, such pandemic will certainly lead to mass casualty events across the globe.",

The WHO has recommended that every country establish a stockpile of enough drugs to treat 20% of its citizens to manage any possible avian influenza pandemic. It works effectively if it is given early within the first 48 hours of the illness with a dosage of one tablet for five days. However, it has some common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of such therapy like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. In 2007, Japanese investigators detected neuraminidase-resistant Influenza B virus strains in individuals who had not been treated with these drugs. The prevalence was 1.7%. It indicates that it might not work if the mutation favours such resistance.[59] The indiscriminate use of antiviral drugs may lead to drug resistance. One of the strategies to prevent drug resistance may be usage of both therapies i.e. zanamivir and oseltamivir.[60]",

Such exercises should have focused objectives with a defined scope and need to simulate a worst case scenario. Tasks to be performed by different participants or emergency functionaries, assessment of their critical needs and role for various facilities are tested in controlled environment. Teams are monitored; flow of action controlled and as observers of exercise, neutral weak areas need to be identified.[65] In addition, the experiential exercise is an effective, inexpensive, and easily able tool for promoting multiple competencies in mass health emergency preparedness for a variety of health care students including medical, veterinary, public health, and nursing students and to test operational capacity and response readiness of various responders.",

It is the responsibility of every stakeholder/essential service provider, policymaker, decision maker to act proactively to prevent/prepare for any such emergency situation. India has proactively launched Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) as part of national health programs. NDMA issued national guidelines for management of biological disasters in July, 2008 as mandated by DM Act, 2005. Guidelines for preparedness/mitigation of pandemics especially by all non-health care providers which need to be integrated with pandemic preparedness health plan were developed by Department of Health and Family Welfare as per WHO guidelines. They include public private partnership models to maintain business continuity of essential sectors and special provisions for different vulnerable groups to be included as a part of overall plan.",

Besides protecting their own citizens, various countries should work in unison towards global mitigation strategy.[66] Adequate preparedness of every essential service provider to sustain their services during pandemics is important. Practising the pandemic medical management plans through simulation-based exercises enhance the level of reflexes and augment the operational readiness. In addition to health sector plans, the execution of business continuity and contingency plan with optimal use of man and material resources is critical to develop disaster resilience. Contingency planning also needs to be in place;[67] if H1N1 again reassorts (by reentering into pigs population) either with seasonal virus or H3N2 virus in pigs, it could lead to changes in its replication and virulence as well as probability of anti viral drug resistance.[57]",
