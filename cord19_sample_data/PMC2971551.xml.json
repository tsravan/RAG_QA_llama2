In previous studies, the extracellular domain was truncated only at the C-terminus by replacing the CRD with a simple two-histidine tag, which allowed efficient binding of the tetrameric neck to chelated nickel columns through the resulting cluster of eight histidine residues.14 Further truncated forms were generated by removing the N-terminal non-repeat region or by removing this region and the first half of the first repeat unit (Fig. 1a). The latter truncation site was based on the presence of a protease-sensitive site immediately after Leu104 in the full-length neck, suggesting that the first part of the neck may be conformationally flexible when released from the membrane and in the absence of the normal N-glycosylation in this repeat.19 Gel filtration suggested that the purified truncated fragment is tetrameric, and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that it retains the stability of the full-length DC-SIGNR neck region, with a melting temperature of 81.7 \u00b0C compared with the measured value of 80.1 \u00b0C for the full-length neck (Fig. 1b and c). Thus, the N-terminal region that has been removed does not contribute significantly to the stability of the tetramer.",

This partial model was rigid-body refined against the native data set. Identical reflections were chosen as test set to calculate Rfree to be consistent with the heavy atom data. The model was further refined in Phenix to 2.2 \u00c5. Completely conserved residues were given occupancy of 1.0, and side chains at the non-conserved positions were built with occupancy assigned based on their frequency in repeats 2 through 7 (Fig. 1a): proline with occupancy of 0.83 and serine with occupancy of 0.17 at position 1 as well as glutamate with occupancy of 0.17, glutamine with occupancy of 0.33, and arginine with occupancy of 0.5 at position 15, resulting in the final refined model described in Table 2.",

The electron density map did not show any features corresponding to repeat 8, which is the least conserved of the repeats. In addition, the 4-fold symmetry places the \u03b1-helices in close proximity, such that the large side chain of a phenylalanine residue at position 20 of repeat 8 (Phe261 in Fig. 1a) would not be accommodated. Both the lack of electron density for the nonconserved side chains in repeat 8 and the positions of the \u03b1-helices suggest that repeat 8 is disordered in the crystal or that diffraction from the nonconserved structure is obscured by the signal from the other six, almost identical, repeats. Thus, there may be gaps of one or more unit cells between successive tetramers along the c axis to accommodate a disordered repeat 8 and the extra residues at the N- and C-termini of the truncated protein.",

The sequence of amino acids in the helical portions of the repeats follows the expected heptad pattern, with hydrophobic amino acids at the a and d positions (Fig. 1a). These hydrophobic residues are positioned toward the center of the bundle and pack against one another (Fig. 2c). There are also multiple hydrophobic, hydrogen-bond, and ionic interactions between side chains within each subunit and between subunits (Fig. 2d). The side chain of Lys17 is not well defined in the map, but it is possible that another rotamer of this residue would allow it to interact with Glu12 (Fig. 2d) to make the interaction proposed by Tabarani et al.25",

The model represents almost exactly the portion of the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR that was previously characterized in hydrodynamic experiments, lacking only three N-terminal and three C-terminal residues.19 The program HydroPro 7c26 was used to predict values for the sedimentation coefficient of s20,w = 5.22 S and the diffusion coefficient of D20,w = 3.37 \u00d7 10\u2212 7 cm2/s, which compare well with the measured values of s20,w = 5.36 S and D20,w = 3.45 \u00d7 10\u2212 7 cm2/s. The fact that the measured values are slightly higher than the predicted values may reflect the fact that the hydrodynamic modeling program is based on a rigid molecule, while in fact the CRDs are not fully fixed in position. The presence of breaks in the \u03b1-helical structure, resulting in relatively short helices of 18 residues abutting non-helical regions at each end, means that there is a much larger end effect in measurements of circular dichroism than would be expected for a continuously helical neck.27 Thus, the segmented nature of the helices accounts for the low estimate of 40% helical content obtained using global fitting algorithms.14",

The rigidity of the structure is consistent with the structure of the neck in DC-SIGNR, in which the four polypeptides interact extensively throughout their length, making the tetramer resistant to bending. However, when the CRDs engage with ligands on an apposed surface, there is a conformational change, probably due to reorientation of the CRDs, which results in a reduction of the overall length to approximately 280 \u00c5. Parallel studies indicate that the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR has similar dimensions and undergoes similar conformational changes (S. Menon, M. E. Taylor, K. Drickamer, and D. A. Leckband, unpublished results). The overall length of the model in Fig. 3c is 265\u2013270 \u00c5, which suggests that the disposition of the CRDs in the model resembles that of the structure engaged with ligand. A model for the DC-SIGNR tetramer with bound oligosaccharide ligand was obtained by superimposing the crystal structure of the CRD complexed with Man3GlcNAc26 (PDB ID 1K9J) onto the CRDs in the model in Fig. 3c and then superimposing the trimannose core of Man9GlcNAc2 onto the equivalent part of Man3GlcNAc2 (Fig. 3d). The resulting model shows that the reducing ends of the oligosaccharides would be oriented upward, consistent with the proposed arrangement when interacting with glycans on a membrane surface.",

Tso, M. E. Taylor, and K. Drickamer, unpublished observations). Nevertheless, the surface force measurements of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are consistent with the idea that there exists a more extended conformation of the extracellular domain that can change to the conformation seen in the crystals. In the light of these considerations, it would be interesting to assess how well the crystallographically observed neck structure would fit the scattering envelope.",

            "text": "Although DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are very similar in amino acid sequence and polypeptide organization, they do display important differences in the neck regions as well as in the CRDs. Some of the differences in the neck region are in the heptad residues of the helical regions, particularly at position 6 in the repeat. The presence of glutamine at position 6 in repeats 6 and 7 in the neck of DC-SIGN, rather than leucine in DC-SIGNR, correlates with the higher stability of the DC-SIGNR neck in thermal denaturation studies. Chimeric necks have the stability properties of DC-SIGNR when they contain leucine at these positions but behave similarly to DC-SIGN when glutamine is present.14 A further key difference is in the final neck repeat, in which the phenylalanine residue at position 20 of the repeat, corresponding to residue 261 in the overall sequence of DC-SIGNR, is replaced by a valine residue in DC-SIGN. The smaller size of the valine side chain means that the helices of the final repeat could be packed similarly to those in the remainder of the neck and the 4-fold symmetry could extend all the way to the end of the molecule. This difference could shift the orientation of the CRDs slightly upward and change the relative disposition of the glycan-binding sites, and it might also explain the difference between the model of DC-SIGNR derived here and that of DC-SIGN in the work of Tabarani et al.25",

            "text": "The structure of the neck of DC-SIGN provides some important insights into how neck length polymorphisms in the DC-SIGNR gene affect the structure of the protein and how these might in turn affect interaction with ligands, such as viral membrane glycoproteins. First, the slight splaying apart of the C-terminal portion of the helical region in the final neck repeat places the CRDs somewhat to the side of rather than at the ends of the helices. As a result, in hetero-oligomers containing a mixture of polypeptides with different numbers of neck repeats, CRDs on the shorter polypeptides would project out from the side of the neck and would thus be accommodated adjacent to a further neck repeat in the longer polypeptide (Fig. 3e). Second, one of the most striking features of the model in Fig. 3e is the twisting of the neck, resulting from the pitch of the supercoiling in the segments of the four-helical bundle and the way that the proline linkers join these segments. As a consequence of this arrangement, the position of the C-terminal end of each repeat is rotated 90\u00b0 from the previous repeat along the polypeptide moving away from the membrane surface. Therefore, in a hetero-oligomer, the position of a CRD on a shorter polypeptide would be rotated 90\u00b0 around the neck as well as translated one repeat length closer to the membrane and would thus be below the CRD in an adjacent, longer repeat rather than next to it. The resulting difference in the orientation of the glycan-binding sites could dramatically affect the relative affinities of homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers for surface glycoproteins on different enveloped viruses.",
