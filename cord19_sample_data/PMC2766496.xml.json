Most people have had a primary HHV-6 infection in early childhood [3] and the virus is widespread in the human population, as shown by the presence of specific antibodies in 90% of healthy adults [17]. As a result of the primary infection, HHV-6 is assumed to establish a latent infection and viral DNA can be detected in salivary glands [7], monocytes [10], and early bone marrow progenitor cells [13].",

Reactivation can lead to illnesses that typically differ in their clinical presentation from the disease associated with the primary infection. After SCT, reactivating members of the \u03b2-herpesvirinae subfamily (among them HHV-6) frequently cause serious, sometimes life-threatening disease [8, 12]. HHV-6 infection or reactivation in these individuals has been associated with a delay or suppression of marrow engraftment [12], pneumonia [2], skin rash, and fever [16]. Although it is difficult to prove an etiologic association of the virus with these disease events, their propinquity with HHV-6 activity in the absence of other possible causes suggests that at the very least a subset of these events is due to HHV-6 activity.",

Eight patients (30%) had detectable viral DNA levels in two or more samples in subsequent tests during the six weeks following SCT and another two (8%) had a single sample positive at a later time. It is likely that the HHV-6 infection that occurred after transplantation was due to activation of the virus in the bodies of the recipients, since most of the recipients were immune to HHV-6 and no virus was found before SCT. However, we do not know whether HHV-6 strains detected in the present study were derived from the donor or were transfered from other sources to the seronegative recipients. The virus probably remains latent in the body after primary infection, as do other human herpesviruses. If the HHV-6 was derived from the donor, it must have been latently infecting the donor\u2019s hemopoietic stem cells and was activated to replicate after transfer to the recipient. In other cases, the virus was probably reactivated from the recipient\u2019s own body by factors such as a profound immune dysfunction or an allogeneic reaction after transplantation.",
