In the last two decades, Latin America saw a dramatic increase in frequency and in geographic extension of dengue fever. Specifically, the situation in Brazil has worsened during the last decade since the introduction of the Dengue-3 serotype. In the past years Brazil had dengue outbreaks with at least 1 million cases (2001\u20132002) and within the last 18 months 900 thousand cases were reported [5]. In addition, severe disease forms are occurring with increased frequency and mortality rates.",

An emerging interest has appeared in order to define biomarkers that may have pathophysiological roles during disease and that may be used as future therapeutic targets. New technologies have been developed in order to detect multiple biomarkers within a single and small blood sample. Such approaches may lead to the development of specific marker panels for dengue fever. Accordingly, cytokine patterns have been indicated as serum biomarkers during infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C [17], ARDS [18] and sepsis [19].",

A multiplex biometric immunoassay, containing fluorescent dyed microspheres conjugated with a monoclonal antibody specific for a target protein, was used for cytokine measurement according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Plex Human Cytokine Assay; Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Cytokines measured were: IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractive protein (MCP-1/CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4), and TNF-\u03b1. Briefly, 20 \u03bcl plasma samples were diluted 1:4 and incubated with antibody-coupled beads. Complexes were washed, then incubated with biotinylated detection antibody and, finally, with streptavidin-phycoerythrin prior to assessing cytokine concentration titres. Concentrated human recombinant cytokine was provided by the vendor (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A range of 1.95\u201332,000 pg/ml recombinant cytokines was used to establish standard curves and to maximize the sensitivity and the assay dynamic range. Cytokine levels were determined using a multiplex array reader from Luminex\u2122 Instrumentation System (Bio-Plex Workstation from Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Activated NK cells release granzyme A, which displays cytolytic functions and MIP-1\u03b2 is chemoattractant for NK cells, recruiting them to inflammatory sites. NK cells have been associated with mild dengue [22]. Here a good correlation between MIP-1\u03b2 plasma levels and NK cells was observed, reinforcing the relevance of these pathways and strongly suggesting their role in dengue protective mechanisms. An early and efficient virus clearance by direct or indirect NK functions is likely controlling virus replication, restricting intense immunological activation and the dengue immunopathology and therefore favouring a mild dengue disease.",

We may hypothesize that differences in Dengue virus serotypes or in host immune response such as different TNF-\u03b1 genetic polymorphisms may explain the disease outcome. In our study from 2001 (Braga et al., 2001), patients were Dengue-2 infected, while in the present study, patients were Dengue-1 and -3 infected. A recent report [43] describes non-significant TNF-\u03b1 serum levels in adult patients and suggests that the discrepancy may have been caused by a transient TNF-\u03b1 peak which was not detected at a later time point.",

IFN-\u03b3 produced by T cells may also activate mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes and dendritic cells), which would produce factors such as TNF-\u03b1, tissue factor, and platelet-activating factor, among other mediators. These factors may all participate in platelet and endothelial cell activation, leading to platelet consumption, increase in endothelial permeability, hypotension and ultimately to shock. IFN-\u03b3 has also been associated with secondary heterologous Dengue virus infections [47,48] inducing a strong antigenically cross-reactive inflammatory response, probably inefficient in terms of antibody and T-cell specific response.

Here we identified cytokines related to dengue severity, but the small sample size represents a shortcoming regarding the generalization of our results. In addition, only one time point was used for the measurement of cytokines, not allowing further insights provided by sequential measurements. Moreover, classification of disease severity has been a matter of debate, especially for adult patients' management and classification. Indeed, the WHO criteria for DHF has failed to identify severe disease, including fatal cases, in adult Latin America population [24,54] (S.M.O. Zagne, R.M.O. Nogueira, unpublished) and clearly do not satisfy the stratification of our studied population. Accordingly, in the present study severe disease forms were classified following other proposed criteria [24]. While a direct correlation of cytokine concentrations and the pathophysiology of severe dengue is tempting, we believe that the full burden of disease severity cannot be attributed to a single cytokine. Cytokines may be increased simply as one of the several steps in the network loops without necessarily playing a direct harmful role and most likely more than one factor may be involved, including others not tested here such as IL-18, TGF-\u03b2, and MIF among others [9].",

MIP-1\u03b2 would be associated with a protective pathway for its chemoattractive and activating effect on NK cells, which in turn are efficient cells in early virus clearance, by their antiviral cytokine production and cytotoxic activity against infected target cells. IFN-\u03b3 has a deleterious effect for the host regarding its action in activating T cells for virus antigenic cross-reactive response and monocyte/dendritic cell activation. Mononuclear monocytes are activated by IFN-\u03b3 and GM-CSF among other cytokines and in turn produce several factors such as IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 that may act on vascular permeability leading to plasma leakage and haemoconcentration. As suggested by other authors, it is likely that viral replication in antigen presenting cells, cytokine liberation and circulation, and T cell activation may not be a linear process [55], but in fact a complex interaction network, with positive and negative feedbacks, where viral clearance and pathologic events take place, such as increased vascular permeability and circulatory collapse, and their balance may determine the disease outcome.",
