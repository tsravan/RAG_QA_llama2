            "text": "The TPB [21] constitutes a promising framework for understanding and predicting social behaviours (Figure 1). The TPB includes perceived behavioural control on a level with attitude and subjective norm as predictors of behavioural intention. This theory implies that the three predictors influence subsequent behaviour indirectly through behavioural intention. The TPB posits that behavioural intention is a function of attitude, reflecting a favourable or unfavourable evaluation of the particular behaviour and subjective norm, referring to the perceived social pressure to perform the behaviour. Perceived behavioural control reflects the ease or difficulty associated with performance. Attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are underpinned by behavioural, normative and control beliefs, respectively. A number of studies have suggested that past behaviour has a residual effect on behavioural intention after the TPB has been taken into account [22,23]. Thus, Ajzen [21] suggested that the TPB is open to the inclusion of additional variables if it can be shown that they capture a significant proportion of the outcome variance.",

The TPB has been used previously in sub-Saharan African settings to predict HIV protective behaviours, however mostly by small scale studies [27]. It has been advocated that the applicability of socio-cognitive models to the African context should be systematically addressed considering the need for theory-based research in the planning of effective HIV and AIDS related educational programs [34,35].",

Personal normative belief or moral norms represents a measure of the personal feelings of moral obligations or responsibility to perform or refuse to perform a given behaviour. Studies of moral norms in the context of the TPB were reviewed by Conner and Armitage [24] who estimated that across investigations moral norms predicted an additional 4% of the variance in intention after controlling for the TPB. Moreover, studies on the Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour have consistently shown that moral considerations are significant predictors of behavioural intentions in the presence of the TPB [37]. Focusing on medical and dental students from Tanzania and Sudan, this study aims to predict the intention to provide surgical treatment to patients with HIV and AIDS as part of future professional work, using the TPB and moral norms.

The effect of country (beta = 0.35, p < 0.001) in step 1 was reduced to (beta = 0.04, p = 0.099) in the final third step, whereas the strength of the effect from past behaviour was maintained from step 1 (beta= 0.08, p < 0.001) to step 3 (beta= 0.06, p < 0.001).

This finding is consistent with those of previous studies, whereby the TPB has explained 68% of nurses' intention to adhere to universal precautions, 48% of health workers' intention to provide home care for HIV infected individuals, 35% of nurses' intention to care for SARS patients and 70% of nurses intended labour support [29-33]. In line with a growing body of research supporting the role of perceived moral obligations as an independent predictor of intention, moral norms contributed 2.3% to the explained variance in students' intentions after controlling for the TPB variables. This factor which has moral connotations and represents personal feelings of responsibility has been considered to be important in the adoption of several health related behaviours [36,37]. Conner and Armitage [25] found that moral norms contributed an additional 4% of the variance in intention after controlling for the TPB across various behaviours. The present results suggest that the TPB and its extended version is useful in the SSA context in terms of identifying correlates of health care delivery that can be targets in interventions aimed at improving health care delivery to HIV infected patients.",

In this study, past experience significantly predicted intention after controlling for the TPB and moral norms and left the cognitive variables of the model almost unaffected. This suggests that the TPB provides a fairly accurate description of the intention formation process considering HIV and AIDS related care delivery among Tanzanian and Sudanese students. Students decide upon care delivery for HIV infected patients mainly as a consequence of situation specific expectations of the behaviour itself and to a lesser extent because they have engaged in similar care delivery previously.",

            "text": "Tanzanian and Sudanese students had on average strong intentions to provide surgical treatment to HIV infected patients as part of their future professional work. In contrast, in a study of Taiwanese nurse students' care intentions, almost all stated that they did not intend to care for HIV infected patients [44]. In this study, intended health care delivery was primarily driven by attitudes followed in descending order of importance by social norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control in both countries. This finding is congruent with findings in other studies of treatment delivery and compliance with precautions in health care workers [29-32]. This finding is also similar to that reported by Sauls [33], who identified attitudes as more influential in determining health care delivery intentions than subjective norms. In contrast, Vermette and Godin [30] found perceived behavioural control to be the strongest influencing factor of nurses' intention to provide home care for HIV infected people. Students who did not express confidence in their ability to circumvent difficulties associated with care delivery, who evaluated care delivery negatively and who felt less normative pressure from colleagues at the faculty and less moral obligations to act were less likely to have strong intentions. These findings add insight to faculty administrators and educators to further develop strategies to increase students' intention to care for patients with HIV and AIDS. Providing sufficient and adequate protective equipments, routinely practicing infection control measures and protocols and providing up to date continuing education and training exercises should improve students' ability to overcome perceived obstacles related to care delivery. Even more important is the enhancement and reinforcement of students' positive attitudes through verbal expression of approval, persuasive messages based on strong arguments, substantial rewards and psychological support by faculty staff to encourage and acknowledge their efforts. Students' decision to provide surgical treatment to HIV infected patients was also influenced by their expectations that faculty colleagues would approve their provision of such treatment. In planning intervention programs, one approach which could be particularly important among students having less care delivery experience is to train peer leaders to communicate the importance of quality care for HIV infected patients. Interventions might also benefit from making students' focus on moral obligations by increasing their awareness of others' needs and their perception that providing quality care could help relieve such needs.",

Self-selection might also be a potential limitation since the students who chose to participate might differ from those who did not implying that only students with interest in health care delivery for HIV infected patients responded to the survey invitation. Students might have over reported intention to provide surgical treatment to HIV infected patients because of social desirability bias. However, a general effect of low reliability is weak associations between variables. Thus, the magnitude of the correlations presented, and the findings harmonizing with the TPB indicate acceptable reliability as well as validity of the results. Past experience as assessed in this study was limited to the extent that it provided no information about the level and frequency of HIV and AIDS related care delivery. Whereas the present findings support the notion that the TPB model is applicable in the sub-Saharan African context, it says nothing about the validity of the model per se, only that the TPB is just as useful in sub Saharan Africa as in other industrialized country contexts.",
